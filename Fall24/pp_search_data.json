Text and pictures version: Step 1: Install Julia  1.10.4 Go to  https://julialang.org/downloads  and download the current stable release, Julia  1.10.4 , using the correct version for your operating system (Linux x86, Mac, Windows, etc). Step 2: Run Julia After installing,  make sure that you can run Julia . On some systems, this means searching for the “Julia  1.10.4 ” program installed on your computer; in others, it means running the command  julia  in a terminal. Make sure that you can execute  1 + 1 : Make sure that you are able to launch Julia and calculate  1+1  before proceeding! Step 3: Install  Pluto Next we will install the  Pluto , the notebook environment that we will be using during the course. Pluto is a Julia  programming environment  designed for interactivity and quick experiments. Open the  Julia REPL . This is the command-line interface to Julia, similar to the previous screenshot. Here you type  Julia commands , and when you press ENTER, it runs, and you see the result. To install Pluto, we want to run a  package manager command . To switch from  Julia  mode to  Pkg  mode, type  ]  (closing square bracket) at the  julia>  prompt: \njulia> ]\n\n(@v 1.10 ) pkg>\n The line turns blue and the prompt changes to  pkg> , telling you that you are now in  package manager mode . This mode allows you to do operations on  packages  (also called libraries). To install Pluto, run the following (case sensitive) command to  add  (install) the package to your system by downloading it from the internet.\nYou should only need to do this  once  for each installation of Julia: \n(@v 1.10 ) pkg> add Pluto\n This might take a couple of minutes, so you can go get yourself a cup of tea! You can now close the terminal. Step 4: Use a modern browser: Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome We need a modern browser to view Pluto notebooks with. Firefox and Chrome work best. Second time:  Running Pluto & opening a notebook Repeat the following steps whenever you want to work on a project or homework assignment. Step 1: Start Pluto Start the Julia REPL, like you did during the setup. In the REPL, type: julia> using Pluto\n\njulia> Pluto.run()\n The terminal tells us to go to  http://localhost:1234/  (or a similar URL). Let’s open Firefox or Chrome and type that into the address bar. If you’re curious about what a  Pluto notebook  looks like, have a look at the  Featured Notebooks . These notebooks are useful for learning some basics of Julia programming. If you want to hear the story behind Pluto, have a look a the  JuliaCon presentation . If nothing happens in the browser the first time, close Julia and try again. And please let us know! Step 2a: Opening a notebook from the web This is the main menu - here you can create new notebooks, or open existing ones. Our homework assignments will always be based on a  template notebook , available in this GitHub repository. To start from a template notebook on the web, you can  paste the URL into the blue box  and press ENTER. For example, homework 0 is available  here . Go to this page, and on the top right, click on the button that says “Edit or run this notebook”. From these instructions, copy the notebook link, and paste it into the box. Press ENTER, and select OK in the confirmation box. The first thing we will want to do is to save the notebook somewhere on our own computer; see below. Step 2b: Opening an existing notebook file When you launch Pluto for the second time, your recent notebooks will appear in the main menu. You can click on them to continue where you left off. If you want to run a local notebook file that you have not opened before, then you need to enter its  full path  into the blue box in the main menu. More on finding full paths in step 3. Step 3: Saving a notebook We first need a folder to save our homework in. Open your file explorer and create one. Next, we need to know the  absolute path  of that folder. Here’s how you do that in  Windows  and  MacOS . In Linux, right click and “Copy file path”. For example, you might have: C:\\Users\\fons\\Documents\\18S191_assignments\\  on  Windows . /Users/fons/Documents/18S191_assignments/  on  MacOS . /home/fons/Documents/18S191_assignments/  on  Ubuntu . Now that we know the absolute path, go back to your Pluto notebook, and at the top of the page, click on  “Save notebook…” . This is where you type the  new path+filename for your notebook : Click  Choose . Step 4: Sharing a notebook After working on your notebook (your code is autosaved when you run it), you will find your notebook file in the folder we created in step 3. This the file that you can share with others, or submit as your homework assignment to Canvas. \nconst run = f => f();\nrun(async () => {\nconst versions = await (await fetch(`https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/versions.json`)).json()\nconst sortby = v => v.split(\"-\")[0].split(\".\").map(parseFloat).reduce((a,b) => a*10000 + b)\nconst version_names = Object.keys(versions).sort((a,b) => sortby(a) - sortby(b)).reverse()\nconst stable = version_names.find(v => versions[v].stable)\nconsole.log({stable})\nconst pkg_stable = /\\d+\\.\\d+/.exec(stable)[0]\ndocument.querySelectorAll(\"auto-julia-version\").forEach(el => {\n    console.log(el)\n    el.innerText = el.getAttribute(\"short\") == null ? stable : pkg_stable\n})\n});"},{"url":"logistics/","title":"Class logistics","tags":["welcome"],"text":"main a img {\n    width: 5rem;\n    margin: 1rem;\n}\n Course logistics MIT Students Only Suggestion : Bookmark this page for easy access to everything you need to follow this class!

The class delves into real-world applications from the very beginning in a way that gives students an opportunity to be excited about the possibilities of computer science and mathematical modelling all while learning how to harness the power and elegance of the modern language of Julia. Class Feedback\n Spring 2020\n This is one of the best classes I have ever taken. I like how the content is divided into four main real-world applications of computational thinking, which made learning very enjoyable and also made working with Julia easier for me. I also found it amazing that this class provided applications of topics in differential equations and linear algebra classes and added a new way to view them. Unfortunately, I haven't found a similar class on computational thinking for the spring as the skills I gain are very practical and needed in research (I was impressed by the number of MISTI research opportunities that asked for experience with agent-based modeling or modeling in general.) Website Feedback\n Spring 2020\n The class website made the class lectures and homework easy to find in addition to the GitHub page and canvas. - The Discord channel and Piazza also made it easier to ask questions and see other students' questions and comments. - The feedback for assignments was very clear, and the instructors were willing to explain my mistakes further by email. Lecture Feedback\n Spring 2020\n The synchronous lectures were very comfortable, and the instructors encouraged us to ask questions.

Two dimensional advection diffusion The two dimensional advection diffusion equation adds advection and diffusion operators acting in a second spatial dimension y that is perpendicular to x . The temperature field T is then a function T T x, y, t , and the PDE becomes \\frac \\partial T x,y,t \\partial t u x,y \\frac \\partial T \\partial x v x,y \\frac \\partial T \\partial y \\kappa \\left \\frac \\partial^ 2 T \\partial x^ 2 \\frac \\partial^ 2 T \\partial y^ 2 \\right , where \\vec u x,y u, v u\\,\\mathbf \\hat x v\\,\\mathbf \\hat y is a velocity vector field, and each partial derivative is also a function of x , y and t . We will think of x as being the longitudinal direction positive from west to east and y as the latitudinal direction positive from south to north . \"\"\" begin reviewBox bind show review CheckBox default false md\"\"\" Review of multivariable calculus identities and notation Check the box for a review reviewBox \"\"\" end if show review md\"\"\" The two dimensional advection diffusion equation is often written more succinctly as \\frac \\partial T x,y,t \\partial t \\vec u \\cdot \\nabla T \\kappa \\nabla^ 2 T, using the following shorthand notation. The gradient operator is defined as \\nabla \\equiv \\left \\frac \\partial \\partial x , \\frac \\partial \\partial y \\right such that \\nabla T \\left \\frac \\partial T \\partial x , \\frac \\partial T \\partial y \\right and \\vec u \\cdot \\nabla T u, v \\cdot \\left \\frac \\partial T \\partial x , \\frac \\partial T \\partial y \\right u \\frac \\partial T \\partial x v\\frac \\partial T \\partial y . The Laplacian operator \\nabla^ 2 , sometimes denoted \\Delta , is defined as \\nabla^ 2 \\frac \\partial^ 2 \\partial x^ 2 \\frac \\partial^ 2 \\partial y^ 2 such that \\nabla^ 2 T \\frac \\partial^ 2 T \\partial x^ 2 \\frac \\partial^ 2 T \\partial y^ 2 . The divergence operator is defined as \\nabla \\cdot \\quad , such that \\nabla \\cdot \\vec u \\left \\frac \\partial \\partial x , \\frac \\partial \\partial x \\right \\cdot u,v \\frac \\partial u \\partial x \\frac \\partial v \\partial y . Note Since seawater is largely incompressible , we have \\nabla \\cdot \\vec u \\frac \\partial u \\partial x \\frac \\partial v \\partial y 0 , i.e. ocean currents are approximately a non divergent flow . Among other implications, this allows us to write \\begin align \\vec u \\cdot \\nabla T& u\\frac \\partial T x,y,t \\partial x v\\frac \\partial T x,y,t \\partial y \\newline & u\\frac \\partial T \\partial x v\\frac \\partial T \\partial y T\\left \\frac \\partial u \\partial x \\frac \\partial v \\partial y \\right \\newline & \\left u\\frac \\partial T \\partial x T\\frac \\partial u \\partial x \\right \\left v\\frac \\partial T \\partial y \\frac \\partial v \\partial y \\right \\newline & \\frac \\partial uT \\partial x \\frac \\partial vT \\partial x \\newline & \\nabla \\cdot \\vec u T \\end align using the product rule separately in both x and y . The flux form two dimensional advection diffusion equation This lets us finally re write the two dimensional advection diffusion equation as \\frac \\partial T \\partial t \\nabla \\cdot \\vec u T \\kappa \\nabla^ 2 T, which is the form we will use in our numerical algorithm below. \"\"\" end md\"\"\" Numerical solution of the 2D equation Discretizing advection in two dimensions In Lecture XX we saw that in one dimension we can discretize a first partial derivative in space using the centered finite difference \\frac \\partial T x i , t n \\partial x \\approx \\frac T i 1 ^ n T i 1 ^ n 2 \\Delta x . In two dimensions, we discretize the partial derivative the exact same way, except that we also need to keep track of the cell index j in the y dimension \\frac \\partial T x i , y j , t n \\partial x \\approx \\frac T i 1,\\, j ^ n T i 1,\\,j ^ n 2 \\Delta x . The x gradient kernel below, implemented using the `OffsetArray` type, is shown below, and is reminiscent of the edge detection or sharpening kernels used in image processing and machine learning \"\"\" md\"\"\" The first order partial derivative in y is similarly discretized as \\frac \\partial T x i , y j , t n \\partial y \\approx \\frac T i,\\, j 1 ^ n T i,\\,j 1 ^ n 2 \\Delta y . Its kernel is shown below. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Now that we have discretized the two derivate terms, we can write out the advective tendency for computing T i, j, n 1 as u\\frac \\partial T \\partial x v\\frac \\partial T \\partial y \\approx u i,\\, j ^ n \\frac T i,\\, j 1 ^ n T i,\\,j 1 ^ n 2 \\Delta y v i,\\, j ^ n \\frac T i,\\, j 1 ^ n T i,\\,j 1 ^ n 2 \\Delta y . We implement this in julia as a series of methods for the `advect` function. The first method computes the advective tendency as a single `Float64` type for the i,j grid cell while the second method returns an array of the tendencies for each grid cell using two nested for loops. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Discretizing diffusion in two dimensions Just as with advection, the process for discretizing the diffusion operators effectively consists of repeating the one dimensional process for x in a second dimension y , separately \\kappa \\left \\frac \\partial^ 2 T \\partial x^ 2 \\frac \\partial^ 2 T \\partial y^ 2 \\right \\kappa \\left \\frac T i 1,\\ j ^ n 2T i,\\ j ^ n T i 1,\\ j ^ n \\left \\Delta x \\right ^ 2 \\frac T i,\\ j 1 ^ n 2T i,\\ j ^ n T i,\\ j 1 ^ n \\left \\Delta y \\right ^ 2 \\right The corresponding x and y second derivative kernels are shown below \"\"\" md\"\"\" Just as we did with advection, we implement a `diffuse` function using multiple dispatch \"\"\" md\"\"\" No flux boundary conditions We want to impose the no flux boundary conditions, which states that u\\frac \\partial T \\partial x \\kappa \\frac \\partial T \\partial x 0 at x boundaries and v\\frac \\partial T \\partial y \\kappa \\frac \\partial T \\partial y 0 at the y boundaries. To impose this, we treat i 1 and i N x as ghost cells , which do not do anything expect help us impose these boundaries conditions. Discretely, the boundary fluxes between i 1 and i 2 vanish if \\dfrac T 2,\\,j ^ n T 1,\\,j ^ n \\Delta x 0 or T 1,\\,j ^ n T 2,\\,j ^ n . Thus, we can implement the boundary conditions by updating the temperature of the ghost cells to match their interior point neighbors \"\"\" function update ghostcells A Array Float64,2 option \"no flux\" Atmp view A , if option \"no flux\" A 1, Atmp 2, Atmp end, Atmp end 1, A , 1 Atmp , 2 Atmp , end Atmp , end 1 end end md\"Let's get a feel for what this is actually doing\" begin A rand Float64, 6,6 heatmap A, size 200, 200 end | as svg begin Acopy copy A update ghostcells Acopy heatmap Acopy, size 200, 200 end | as svg md\"\"\" Timestepping \"\"\" md\"\"\" Data structures \"\"\" begin struct Grid N Int64 L Float64 Δx Float64 Δy Float64 x Array Float64,2 y Array Float64,2 Nx Int64 Ny Int64 function Grid N, L Δx L N m Δy L N m x 0.

But the Earth does not have a single, uniform temperature rather, at a particular moment in time, different places on Earth are at different temperatures, and those different temperatures change over time due to several mechanisms. In this notebook we will look at two fundamental mechanisms advection and diffusion . Let's think about the temperature in the ocean. Since the ocean is a fluid that is in motion, a warm \"parcel\" of water can flow move to a new location due to the physical motion of the water itself this is advection . And even if the water doesn't move, temperature or a higher concentration of some substance dissolved in the fluid can spread out due to molecular mechanisms this is diffusion . \"\"\" md\"\"\" In this notebook we will restrict ourselves to one spatial dimension 1D . So we will think about the temperature T , for example, being a function T t, x of two independent variables time, t space, x We want to calculate a value of the temperature T for each possible pair of values t, x , i.e. for all time 0 and all positions. The temperature at a given point will change due to different physical processes. We need to model this by writing down equations describing each physical process and how it affects the temperature. Since there are now two independent variables, t and x , we can expect to end up with derivatives with respect to both of these variables, so that the rate of change of temperature in time at a given point depends also on gradients of the temperature in space . This will lead to a partial differential equation that relates partial derivatives of T . In the context of climate modelling, we can think of x as being the latitude , supposing that the temperature is the same at all points with the same latitude. In this way we could model the fact that the poles are cold and the equator is warm, and we could model how heat flows from hot to cold. However, we clearly cannot model actual ocean currents like this, which would require two, or even three, spatial dimensions. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Visualising advection diffusion \"\"\" md\"\"\" Here is a visualisation of the physical processes of advection and diffusion in one dimension that we will discuss and build during this notebook. \"\"\" md\"\"\" U bind UU Slider 1 0.01 1, show value true, default 0 D bind DD Slider 0.2 0.001 0.2, show value true, default 0 \"\"\" md\"\"\" Temperature profiles and discretization \"\"\" md\"\"\" An ordinary differential equation needs an initial value for each variable. Similarly, we will need an initial function T 0 x that gives us the temperature at each position x . Let's suppose that the position is restricted to the interval 0, L x . As usual, to represent the continuous function T 0 x on a computer, we will need to discretise it in some way, i.e. approximate the continuous function by a finite set of numbers in the computer. The simplest but far from the only discretisation method is to sample the function at discrete grid points or nodes x i , for i 1, \\dots, N x . For simplicity we will take these equally spaced, with spacing x i 1 x i \\delta x L x N x . \"\"\" md\"\"\" For example, let's consider the following initial temperature profile \"\"\" T₀ x sin 2π x ^2 0.5 T₀ x sin 2π x 2 cos 4π x 0.2 md\"\"\" and define the grid points as follows \"\"\" begin Nₓ 20 Lₓ 1.0 δx Lₓ Nₓ xs δx 2 δx Lₓ end xs md\"\"\" It turns out to be a good idea to take the grid points at the centre of each interval, so that we have N x intervals and N x grid points, starting at x 1 \\delta x 2 and finishing at x N L x \\delta x 2 . \"\"\" md\"\"\" We call such a function of x at a given time a temperature profile . Let's draw it both as a function and as a heatmap \"\"\" md\"\"\" We will denote by T^0 i the initial temperature at grid point number i . \"\"\" md\"\"\" A useful way to think about T^n i is as some kind of spatial average of T t n, x over the interval of positions between neighbouring grid points, so T i is the average over the interval between x i \\frac \\delta x 2 and x i \\frac \\delta x 2 . We can thus think of the following piecewise constant approximation to the original continuous function \"\"\" let δx xs 2 xs 1 p plot 0 0.001 Lₓ, T₀, label \"T₀\", lw 1, ls dash scatter xs, T₀. xs , label \"sampled\" scatter xs, zero. xs , label \"x nodes\", alpha 0.5, ms 3, lw 2 for i in 1 length xs plot xs i δx 2, T₀ xs i , xs i δx 2, T₀ xs i , c green, lw 4, lab false plot xs i δx 2, 0 , xs i δx 2, T₀ xs i , xs i δx 2, T₀ xs i , xs i δx 2, 0 , c green, lw 1, lab false, ls dash, alpha 0.3 end xlabel \"x\" ylabel \"T₀ x \" end md\"\"\" Advection \"\"\" md\"\"\" Now let's think of this profile as representing the temperature in each small volume, or \"parcel\", of fluid. Let's suppose that the fluid is moving to the right with a constant, uniform speed U . Uniform here means that the speed is the same in all parts of the fluid. Then the temperature profile should also move with the fluid We call a quantity, such as the temperature, that is carried along with the fluid a tracer . If we fix our attention at a single, fixed point in space, say the grid point x i , the temperature there will vary over time, due to the fact that the fluid is moving past it. How it varies in time depends on the values at neighbouring grid points, since they determine how much heat will be transported into and out of the current cell. The point of view where we fix our attention at one point in space is called Eulerian . The alternative is to follow a parcel of fluid as it moves along in space this is called Lagrangian . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Visualising fluxes in a fluid \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's visualise what happens as the fluid moves past a grid point, or rather the cell centered at a grid point. We will visualise tracer particles moving inside the fluid \"\"\" N 5000 begin xx abs. 2 . 4 . rand N .^ 2 . 1.5 yy rand N end δ 0.8 md\"\"\" show particles entering and leaving in \\delta t bind show particles CheckBox \"\"\" md\"\"\" t bind t Slider 0 0.001 2, show value true, default 0 \"\"\" md\"\"\" Time stepping \"\"\" md\"\"\" We want to model how the temperature profile changes in time due to the flow of the fluid. We'll do so by looking at each cell and asking how much heat enters and leaves the cell in a given time step, of duration \\delta t . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's call T^n i the approximate unknown average value of T in the cell at position x i and at the n th time step t n , i.e. an approximation of T t n, x i , where t n n \\, \\delta t . Then T^ n 1 i \\simeq T t n \\delta t, x i and T^ n i 1 \\simeq T t n, x i \\delta x . Note that the superscript n in these algorithms does not mean a power it's just a label for the time step. We could write T i^ n instead, but that is annoying to both write and read, so we omit the parentheses. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Suppose the fluid is moving to the right with speed U . During a time step of duration \\delta t , the temperature T^n i at cell i changes for two reasons some heat enters cell i some heat leaves cell i Note that most of the fluid that starts within cell i remains within that cell during the time step if the time step is short enough , as we see from the visualisation above. To calculate how much heat enters and leaves, note that only heat in the region of fluid within a distance U \\, \\delta t from the boundary of the cell will cross into that cell. So a proportion U \\, \\delta t \\delta x of the amount in cell i crosses the boundary. We will blur the distinction between \"amount of heat\" and temperature. Hence, roughly an amount T^n i U \\delta t \\delta x will leave cell number i and cross into cell i 1 the cell to the right . Similarly, an amount T^n i 1 U \\delta t \\delta x will enter cell i from the neighbouring cell i 1 on the left. Hence we arrive at the following T^ n 1 i T^ n i T^n i 1 T^n i \\, U \\, \\delta t \\delta x. Note that on the right hand side we have quantities at the time step n , and on the left at time step n 1 . So this tells us how to update our quantities from slice n to slice n 1 . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Continuous limit Advection equation PDE \"\"\" md\"\"\" Rearranging the previous equation we get \\frac T^ n 1 i T^ n i \\delta t \\frac T^n i 1 T^n i \\delta x \\, U. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Taking the continuum limit when \\delta t \\to 0 and \\delta x \\to 0 , we recognise the definition of partial derivatives with respect to time and space variables from multivariable calculus. Note the different indices that change on the two sides of the equation. Denoting these partial derivatives using \\partial , we arrive at the advection equation \\frac \\partial T t, x \\partial t U \\frac \\partial T t, x \\partial x , or for short \\frac \\partial T \\partial t U \\frac \\partial T \\partial x . Since T is a function of both x and t , and this equation involves partial derivatives with respect to both of the independent variables, this is a partial differential equation PDE . It describes how the function T t, x changes continuously as a function both of time and space. Although there are some analytical methods to solve PDEs, often it's necessary to use numerical methods. Here we'll look at simple numerical methods to solve such equations. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Numerics for the advection equation \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's return to the version of the equation in which the value at the following time step is isolated T^ n 1 i T^ n i \\left U \\frac \\delta t \\delta x \\right T^n i T^n i 1 . In the last term on the right hand side, we see that we require combinations of values of T at the same time step from different places, with certain coefficients. \"\"\" md\"\"\" There are many approaches to implementing this numerically. The simplest is to directly transcribe the equation for the i th entry of the vector. Calling `T` the current vector, i.e. \\mathbf T ^n T^n i i 1, \\ldots, N x , and `T′` the new vector at the next time step, we have the following basic expression T′ i T i δt U T i 1 T i δx But now we realise a problem What should we do when i 1 ? This will try to access the index 0 of the vector `T`, which does not exist \"\"\" md\"\"\" Boundary conditions This illustrates the necessity of choosing boundary conditions that specify what happens at the edge of the domain. For simplicity we will choose to use periodic boundary conditions . This is a convenient mathematical fiction that allows us to treat all cells as being on the same footing, by wrapping the system around a torus, so that cells i 1 and i N x are neighbours. \"\"\" md\"\"\" We can then write this as follows, where we separate out the case i 1 \"\"\" function advection T, δt, δx, U N length T T′ similar T create new vector of the same length bulk cells for i in 2 N T′ i T i δt U T i T i 1 δx end boundary cells T′ 1 T 1 δt U T 1 T N δx periodic return T′ end md\"\"\" This performs a single time step of the advection equation it takes in the current vector of T s and returns the new T s after the step. Note that this is just like a step of the Euler method for solving ODEs, but where many spatial coordinates are updated at the same time. Effectively we are solving a system of coupled ODEs \"\"\" δt 0.001 U 0.2 assign colours to particles cs map xx do x if U δ x 0 1 elseif 1 U δ x 1 2 else 0 end end begin plot 0, 1, 1, 0, 0 , 0, 0, 1, 1, 0 , series shape, alpha 0.5, fill true, ratio 1, label false, leg false new xx xx .

This is due to the way we are approximating. A better way to discretize the spatial derivative is using the following centered difference \\frac \\partial T t n, x i \\partial x \\simeq \\frac T^n i 1 T^n i 1 2 \\delta x \"\"\" function advection2 T, δt, δx, U N length T T′ similar T create new vector of the same length for i in 2 N 1 T′ i T i δt U T i 1 T i 1 2δx end periodic boundary T′ 1 T 1 δt U T 2 T N 2δx T′ N T N δt U T 1 T N 1 2δx return T′ end md\"\"\" Diffusion \"\"\" md\"\"\" Another key physical process is diffusion . This models how temperature or mass spreads out from hot or high concentration regions towards regions where it is cold or where there is a low concentration. Physical mechanism Random walks The physical mechanism behind this is random motion this is the continuous limit of equations describing the evolution of the probability distribution in space and time of a cloud of random walkers. This is the same process that we studied in lecture 2.6. Using our current notation, there we showed that the probability distribution of a cloud of random walkers satisfies the following time evolution p^ n 1 i \\frac 1 2 p^n i 1 p^n i 1 If now we say that the walkers jump only with a certain probability, with a large probability to stay in the same place, and that these random walkers are the carriers of heat, then we get T^ n 1 i \\kappa T^n i 1 2 T^n i T^n i 1 . Watch this video https www.youtube.com watch?v a3V0BJLIo c from last semester's class to see Grant Sanderson explaining this. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Continuous limit Heat equation PDE \"\"\" md\"\"\" Introducing \\delta x as the spatial discretisation, and \\delta t as the time step, we get T^ n 1 i \\kappa \\frac \\delta t \\delta x^2 T^n i 1 2 T^n i T^n i 1 . \"\"\" md\"\"\" The continuous limit is the following heat equation or diffusion equation \"\"\" md\"\"\" \\frac \\partial T \\partial t \\kappa \\frac \\partial^2 T \\partial x^2 . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Here, \\kappa is the heat diffusivity , which says how quickly heat spreads out. In the context of diffusion of mass the equivalent is the diffusion coefficient , D . \"\"\" md\"\"\" To obtain a numerical method to solve this equation, we again need to discretise this, in particular the second derivative. One possible discretisation is \\frac \\partial^2 T \\partial x^2 t n, x i \\simeq \\frac T^n i 1 2 T^n i T^n i 1 \\delta x^2 . \"\"\" md\"\"\" This may again be transcribed directly into code \"\"\" function diffusion T, δt, δx, D N length T T′ similar T create new vector of the same length for i in 2 N 1 T′ i T i δt D T i 1 2T i T i 1 δx^2 end periodic boundary T′ 1 T 1 δt D T 2 2T 1 T N δx^2 T′ N T N δt D T 1 2T N T N 1 δx^2 return T′ end md\"\"\" The advection diffusion PDE \"\"\" md\"\"\" Finally we can combine both mechanisms, to describe a tracer that is both being advected at a constant speed and diffusing.

In the case of large variations, however, this approximation is not very reliable. While oceans are dark and absorbant, α ocean \\approx 0.05 , ice and snow are bright and reflective \\alpha ice,\\,snow \\approx 0.5 to 0.9 . Thus, if much of the ocean's surface freezes over, we expect Earth's albedo to rise dramatically, causing more sunlight to be reflected to space, which in turn causes even more cooling and more of the ocean to freeze, etc. This non linear positive feedback effect is referred to as the ice albedo feedback see illustration below . \"\"\" function α T α0 Model.α, αi 0.5, ΔT 10. if T ΔT return αi elseif ΔT T ΔT return αi α0 αi T ΔT 2ΔT elseif T ΔT return α0 end end begin T example 20. 1. 20. plot size 600, 400 , ylims 0.2, 0.6 plot 20, 10 , 0.2, 0.2 , fillrange 0.6, 0.6 , color lightblue, alpha 0.2, label nothing plot 10, 20 , 0.2, 0.2 , fillrange 0.6, 0.6 , color red, alpha 0.12, label nothing plot T example, α.

The preindustrial combination of natural greenhouse effect and incoming solar radiation yielded temperatures between the freezing and boiling points of water across most of the planet, allowing ecoystems based on liquid water to thrive. The climate system, however, is rife with non linear effects like the ice albedo effect , which reveal just how fragile our habitable planet is and just how unique our stable pre industrial climate was. We learned in Lecture 20 that in response to temperature fluctuations, net negative feedbacks act to restore Earth's temperature back towards a single equilibrium state in which absorbed solar radiation is balanced by outgoing thermal radiation. Here, we explore how non linear positive feedbacks can temporarily result in a net positive feedback and modify Earth's state space. \"\"\" md\"\"\" 2.1 Exploring the non linear ice albedo feedback In Lecture 20 Part II https www.youtube.com watch?v D3jpfeQCISU , we learned how introducing non linear terms in ordinary differential equations can lead to complex state spaces that allow for multiple fixed points e.g. for \\dot x \\mu x^ 2 . Let's explore how this plays out with the non linear ice albedo feedback by varying the initial condition T 0 \\equiv T t 0 and allowing the system to evolve for 200 years. \"\"\" begin T0 slider bind T0 interact Slider 60. 0.0025 30., default 24., show value true md\"\"\" T₀ T0 slider °C\"\"\" end begin ebm interact Model.EBM Float64 T0 interact , 0., 1., Model.CO2 const Model.run ebm interact, 200 end md\"We can get an overview of the behavior by drawing a set of these curves all on the same graph \" begin p equil plot xlabel \"year\", ylabel \"temperature °C \", legend bottomright, xlims 0, 205 , ylims 60, 30. plot 0, 200 , 60, 60 , fillrange 10., 10. , fillalpha 0.3, c lightblue, label nothing annotate 120, 20, text \"completely frozen\", 10, darkblue plot 0, 200 , 10, 10 , fillrange 30., 30. , fillalpha 0.09, c red, lw 0., label nothing annotate 120, 25, text \"no ice\", 10, darkred for T0 sample in 60. 5. 30. ebm Model.EBM T0 sample, 0., 1., Model.CO2 const Model.run ebm, 200 plot p equil, ebm.t, ebm.T, label nothing end T un 7.5472 for δT in 1.e 2 2, 1., 0., 1., 2. ebm un Model.EBM T un δT, 0., 1., Model.CO2 const Model.run ebm un, 200 plot p equil, ebm un.t, ebm un.T, label nothing, linestyle dash end plot p equil, 200 , Model.T0 , markershape circle, label \"Our pre industrial climate stable ''warm'' branch \", color orange, markersize 8 plot p equil, 200 , 38.3 , markershape circle, label \"Alternate universe pre industrial climate stable ''cold'' branch \", color aqua, markersize 8 plot p equil, 200 , T un , markershape diamond, label \"Impossible alternate climate unstable branch \", color lightgrey, markersize 8, markerstrokecolor white, alpha 1. p equil end md\"We see that for T₀ ⪆ round T un, digits 2 °C, all of the curves seem to converge on the T 14°C equilibrium or fixed point that we saw in Lecture 20. Curves that start below this value warm up and while curves that start above this value will cool down. For T₀ ⪅ round T un, digits 2 °C, however, the temperatures converge on a much colder equilibrium around T 40°C. This is the Snowball Earth equilibrium. These two states are referred to as stable equilibria because even if the state gets temporarily pushed slightly away from its equilibrium, it will eventually converge right back to its equilibrium. So what happens is T₀ ≈ round T un, digits 2 °C? For some exact temperature near there, there is indeed an equilibrim state if you start with that temperature you will stay there forever. However, if the temperature starts off even one one hundredth of a degree above or below this exact value, we see that temperatures eventually converge to one of the other two equilibria. Thus, we call this intermediate equilibrium an unstable equilibrium , because any infinitesimal push away will cause it to careen away towards another state. \" md\"\"\" 2.2 Radiative stability analysis We can understand why our model has two stable equilibria and one unstable equilibrium by applying concepts from dynamical systems theory.

If you were sharing changes in realtime like Google Drive , then other people would get those broken states while working on their features. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Synchronizing every keystroke \"\"\" md\"\"\" However, if we only publish code manually , we can make sure that we never publish broken code. This means that my collaborators, who might be working on the project at the same time, will not have to deal with errors that are coming from my work in progress changes. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Synchronizing manually \"\"\" md\"\"\" Even larger chunks In the previous example, we found that we can avoid publishing invalid syntax by not synchronizing on every keystroke like Google Docs, but by synchronizing manually. We also don't want to synchronize the file every time it is saved , because you often try multiple things before finding something that works. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Synchronizing every save \"\"\" md\"\"\" Synchronizing manually \"\"\" pass2 html\" span style 'opacity .3' ✅ span \" pass \"✅\" | HTML fail \"❌\" | HTML md\"\"\" Reason 2 branches and forks Reason 2 It should be easy to split a project into multiple branches copies of the codebase that can be worked on independently. And after some time, we want to compare branches and merge the new additions into one. Something that you may have done create a copy of your `presentation.ppt` called `presentation with pictures.ppt` before adding your pictures, and if it didn't work, you can go back to yesterday's backup. Now that's great, but what if your teammate also made a copy `presentation with titlepage.ppt` where they also made a change? In this situation, you have created two branches of the same file in parallel, and it will be difficult to combine those changes back into a single `presentation this one really.ppt` file. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Reason 3 automation Reason 3 Git is a platform for automation , and can be a mechanism to automatically test and review changes, release weekly versions, etc etc. Programmers love to automate things, and git allows all sorts of automation. At first, this can be intimidating , and it will take years of experience to learn all the possible tricks. Someone who does 'git magic' as a profession is called a DevOps https en.wikipedia.org wiki DevOps engineer . Don't worry about this too much when getting started with GitHub, and ask others for help if necessary. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Automatic testing While we don't recommend learning about git automation right away, one thing you will probably encounter when contributing to an open source project is automatic testing . More on this later \"\"\" bigbreak html\"\"\" br br br br br br br br \"\"\" bigbreak bigbreak md\"\"\" Our first contribution documentation Today will be a kick start into contributing to open source projects The easiest way to make a great contribution to packages is to contribute a documentation improvement . For our example today, we will look at the package ClimateMARGO.jl https github.com ClimateMARGO ClimateMARGO.jl , a climate economic model. This package is hosted on GitHub, which means that all code and previous versions of code is available at github.com ClimateMARGO ClimateMARGO.jl https github.com ClimateMARGO ClimateMARGO.jl . The authors also use the same GitHub site to manage their TO DOs — called Issues https github.com ClimateMARGO ClimateMARGO.jl issues — and to accept contributions from others — called Pull Requests https github.com ClimateMARGO ClimateMARGO.jl pulls . Today, we are going to make a Pull Request \"\"\" md\"\"\" What is a Pull Request? Julia packages are open source , which means that you are allowed and encouraged to make your own copy of the source code we call this a fork and modify it. If you made some good changes on your fork then you can suggest to changes to the original project by submitting your code as a Pull Request PR . This is a feature built in to GitHub, and this is how most code collaboration happens online. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Video tutorial will be available here after the live lecture. \"\"\" md\"\"\" After the Pull Request Submitting your Pull Request is a great feeling, but it's not the last step After your submission, the PR will be reviewed by the project authors, and they will leave their feedback. It is common that a PR is not merged accepted directly, but that you are asked to make some small changes. This is possible because a Pull Request is not static — you can make changes to the PR after submitting it Remember that a PR is from one branch to another . You can make changes to your PR simply by adding additional commits to the from branch. \"\"\" md\"\"\" As an example of a Pull Request in the wild, let's look at this PR to `JuliaLang julia` github.com JuliaLang julia pull 40596 https github.com JuliaLang julia pull 40596 . The code change is not so important to us right now, but pay attention to the communication around the code change. \"\"\" md\"\"\" How to use GitHub Enough talk, let's create our first repository \"\"\" md\"\"\" Requirements To follow this introduction, you will need Create an account at github.com github.com . Add a friendly profile picture For Windows & MacOS users, download GitHub Desktop https desktop.github.com , a graphical program to easily manage git repositories on your disk. Linux users can use the slightly more advanced program GitKraken https www.gitkraken.com . A code editor. If you don't have a code editor yet, or if you are using Notepad, gedit or Notepad , we highly recommend VS Code https code.visualstudio.com , an open source, beginner friendly programming environment. It may seem like something new and difficult to learn, but it is easy to use, and because it understands the code that you are writing, it will help you as a beginner programmer. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Video tutorial will be available here after the live lecture. \"\"\" md\"\"\" ⛑ Git trouble Sooner or later, you will find yourself in git trouble . Unlike Google Drive, it can happen that synchronization requires manual intervention, for example, git might say `🤐 merge conflict` Which means that someone changed a file right before you were going to commit. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Fonsi's Git Trouble Fix™ Many git problems have an 'official' solution, and it will take time to learn all of these techniques. In the meantime, here is my fool proof way of solving many tricky git situations \"\"\" md\"\"\" Step 1 Use GitHub Desktop to find out which files you have changed. Are the changes important? Step 2 Take any files that you want to keep, and copy them to a different folder, e.g. your desktop. Step 3 Remove your local clone of the repository, and move any leftover files to the trash. Step 4 Clone the repository again, and copy your files back to their original place, overwriting the cloned files. \"\"\" bigbreak md\"\"\" How to fork and contribute code \"\"\" md\"\"\" Video tutorial will be available here after the live lecture. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Tests People often write tests for their code As part of the codebase, there will be a `test` folder containing scripts that will import the project and run some basic checks. \"\"\" function double x x x end test double 3 6 test double 0 0 md\"\"\" One reason to write tests is to pin specific behaviour, protecting yourself from accidentally changing it later. For example, if you fix a bug that `double 2 ` returns `40` instead of `4`, you would also add a test for `double 2 4`. Months later, when you are changing `double` for another use case, the old test insures that you are not accidentally breaking something that was once fixed. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Running tests You can run the tests of any Julia package by opening the Julia REPL, and typing ```julia julia v1.6 pkg test Example ``` As mentioned before, many project use github magic to automatically run their tests on a server for every change, and you can view the test results online. An important application is running tests for every Pull Request. This means that package authors can quickly review your changes, knowing that it does not break anything. \"\"\" bigbreak md\"\"\" Extra tips \"\"\" md\"\"\" Contributing does not only mean contributing code https opensource.guide how to contribute https opensource.guide how to contribute \"\"\" md\"\"\" Create a \"test\" repository Create multiple \"\"\" md\"\"\" Appendix \"\"\" function ingredients path String this is from the Julia source code evalfile in base loading.jl but with the modification that it returns the module instead of the last object name Symbol basename path m Module name Core.eval m, Expr toplevel, eval x Expr core, eval name, x , include x Expr top, include name, x , include mapexpr Function, x Expr top, include mapexpr, name, x , include path m end Layout ingredients download \"https raw.githubusercontent.com fonsp disorganised mess 5a59ad7cff1e760b997a54ffa0f8fa202ac16db3 Layout.jl\" stackrows x permutedims hcat x... , 2, 1 flex x Union AbstractVector,Base.Generator kwargs... flex x... kwargs... begin Base. kwdef struct Div contents style Dict end Div x Div contents x function Base.show io IO, m MIME\"text html\", d Div h htl \"\"\" div style d.style d.contents div \"\"\" show io, m, h end end outline x Div x, Dict \"border\" \"3px solid rgba 0,0,0,.3 \", \"border radius\" \"3px\", \"padding\" \"5px\", Div md\"\"\" ```julia function height p c1 sqrt p c2 end ``` \"\"\", md\"to\", md\"\"\" ```julia function height p c1 log p c2 end ``` \"\"\" , Dict \"display\" \"flex\", \"justify content\" \"space evenly\", \"align items\" \"center\", function flex args... kwargs...

to minimize climate suffering This interactive article lets you – the reader– run MARGO https github.com ClimateMARGO ClimateMARGO.jl , a simple climate model, to explore what it takes to avoid the catastrophic impacts of global warming. The code in this webpage is reactive , meaning that the graphs and numbers automatically update whenever you change the climate model's inputs. By Henri F. Drake https hdrake.github.io and Fons van der Plas Can you limit human caused global warming to \"well below 2ºC\"? \"\"\" md\"\"\" image https user images.githubusercontent.com 6933510 118835384 3ad36c80 b8c3 11eb 995d 70cba3b23846.png From ClimateMARGO.jl https github.com ClimateMARGO ClimateMARGO.jl \"\"\" md\"\"\" Overview of the climate problem from greenhouse gas emissions to climate suffering Human emissions of greenhouse gases, especially Carbon Dioxide CO₂ , increase the stock of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. For every molecule of CO₂ emitted, about 50% are taken up by plants, soils, or the ocean within a few years, while the rest remains in the atmosphere. The effects of other greenhouse gases, such as Methane and CFCs, and other forcing agents, can approximately be converted into the \"CO₂ equivalent\"– or CO₂ₑ– concentrations that would lead to the same climate forcing . Greenhouse gases get their name because they trap invisible heat radiation emitted by Earth's surface and atmosphere from escaping to space, much like greenhouses trap hot air from rising when it is warmed by the Sun. This \"greenhouse effect\" causes the temperature to rise globally, although some places warm more and faster than others. Warmer temperatures exacerbate both the frequency and intensity of \"natural\" disasters, such as heat waves, coastal flooding from major hurricanes, and inland flooding from torrential rain. These climate impacts lead to enhanced climate suffering, which economics typically attempt to quantify suffering in terms of lost money or welfare. In the interactive article below, we invite you to explore the benefits of emissions mitigation and carbon dioxide removal in reducing climate suffering, and the trade offs with their costs. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Mitigating emissions Human greenhouse gas emissions are the result of fossil fuel burning e.g. for transportation, electricity generation, heating, industry , unsustainable agriculture, and land use changes. We refer to any actions or policies that reduce these emissions as mitigation . The MARGO model lumps all potential mitigation into a single number the percentage of baseline emissions that are mitigated in a given year. Baseline emissions are the emissions that would arise in a hypothetical future world absent of climate policy. In our hypothetical no policy world, we assume that emissions will go to zero by 2150 even without climate policy, perhaps because of public health concerns regarding other forms of air pollution, the development of new zero carbon technologies, or running out of extractable fossil fuels resources. In the plot below, drag the blue dot around to vary the amount and timing of mitigation, and observe how these changes affect key climate variables, using the drop box menu CO₂ₑ emissions, CO₂ₑ concentrations, and global temperature. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Cost & damages \"\"\" bind cost benefits narrative slide Carousel md\"\"\" 1. The costs of climate suffering In the absence of climate action, temperatures would rise over 4.5ºC above preindustrial levels 1800 to 1850 average , causing catastrophic climate impacts. MARGO attempts to quantify this suffering by translating the degree of warming into economic damages in \\ year . The curve below shows how climate damages rise over time, as a percentage of the World Gross Domestic Product WGDP in that year, due to uncontrolled temperature increases. \"\"\", md\"\"\" 2. Avoiding climate damages Emissions mitigation limits future warming and climate suffering Damages curve . The economic benefits of mitigation are given by the difference in damages relative to the no policy scenario Baseline curve minus Damages curve . In the figure below, drag around the blue dot to change the future mitigation strategy, and observe how the Avoided damages the grey area change \"\"\", md\"\"\" 3. Cost benefit analysis Unfortunately, mitigating CO₂ₑ emissions also carries a cost. In MARGO, the marginal cost of mitigation is proportional to the fraction of CO₂ₑ emissions that have been mitigated in a given year, increasing up to a maximum of 70 per metric ton of CO₂ₑ at 100% mitigation. This naturally leads to a cost benefit analysis . We search for the most beneficial, or optimal , scenario the one with the maximum net present benefits . In the figure below, try finding a mitigation strategy that optimizes these Net benefits . \"\"\" wraparound false if cost benefits narrative slide 1 hidecloack \"cost benefits narrative input\" end md\"\"\" Picking up the slack carbon dioxide removal While substantial emissions mitigations are necessary to reduce future climate suffering, they can not make up for the hundreds of billions of tons of CO₂ that humans have already emitted. However, both natural and technological methods for removing CO₂ from the atmosphere exist. Although they are presently miniscule compared to the tens of gigatons scale of global emissions, experts expect that they will play a key role in the future. In MARGO, we do not distinguish between different carbon dioxide removal methods, and further assume that the carbon is stored permanently. Drag the yellow dot in the figure below to modify the amount and timing of carbon dioxide removal . \"\"\" md\"\"\" MARGO's automated optimization In the above example, you manually adjusted the timing and amount of mitigation and carbon dioxide removal, but did not have much control on the shape of curves. Using a computer algorithm, we can do this optimization step automatically and faster , without having to assume anything about the shape of the mitigation and carbon dioxide removal curves. \"\"\" blob md\"\"\" Maximum temperature `0.0 °C` Tmax 9 slider `5.0 °C` Allow temperature overshoot allow overshoot 9 cb \"\"\", \" c5710014\" md\"\"\" Appendix This interactive page is a Pluto notebook https github.com fonsp Pluto.jl , which means that it contains its own source code, and we encourage you to take a look behind the scenes.

These are equations relating a function to its derivatives, telling us how to move at each moment in time. For example, exponential decay is modelled by \\dot u p \\, u, in other words \\dot u t p \\, u t for all real t \\ge 0 , with initial condition u 0 u 0 where u t is the number of light bulbs still functioning at time t , the number of radioactive nuclei that have not yet decayed, or the number of people who are still infectious and have not yet recovered. The parameter p is the decay rate. We saw that time stepping methods provide a class of numerical methods for solving such initial value problems, of which the Euler method is the simplest example. Unfortunately the Euler method is not a good choice, since it is not accurate enough. In numerical analysis classes like 18.330 https github.com mitmath 18330 various better methods are derived. Fortunately those methods are available in a Julia library or package, `DifferentialEquations.jl`. \"\"\" md\"\"\" The `DifferentialEquations.jl` library \"\"\" md\"\"\" DifferentialEquations.jl https diffeq.sciml.ai v2.0 often abbreviated as DiffEq is a Julia library for solving many types of differential equations. It has become the best most complete and fastest general library for solving ordinary differential equations and many other types in any programming environment. It is also a very good example of the way that Julia libraries are often structured. We will see some basic usage examples and how Julia types are used both to control the library and to store the input and output to the solvers . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Basic usage of DifferentialEquations.jl \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's try to solve the above equation that we derived in the previous lecture, \\dot u p \\, u . We are using u as the name of the dependent variable for consistency with the `DifferentialEquations.jl` documentation and internal structure. We write a general ODE in 1 variable as \\dot u f p t, u . The right hand side of the ODE is given by a function f , which may depend on a parameter p , i.e. a constant which does not change for any given run of the ODE. f may also depend explicitly on time. In our example we do indeed have a parameter p that we want to change, but f does not have an explicit time dependence, so we write \"\"\" f u, p, t p u md\"\"\" Note that you always need the three input arguments `u`, `p` and `t`, in that order, even if you don't use them. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Now we define our initial condition u 0 and the time span to integrate over, given as a tuple initial\\ time, final\\ time \"\"\" begin u0 100.0 time span 0.0, 10.0 end md\"\"\" To set up the problem instance we use a type `ODEProblem` that is defined in the `DifferentialEquations.jl` package, into which we pass all the information necessary to define the problem. The parameters must go in the following order \"\"\" md\"\"\" For more advanced use there are also some additional, optional, keyword arguments. Note that the displayed output does not currently include information about the function, nor the parameters. \"\"\" md\"\"\" To solve the ODE we call the `solve` function \"\"\" md\"\"\" What happened here? A suitable solver i.e. an algorithm to calculate the solution was chosen automatically , and it chose certain moments in time at which to output information about the approximate, but very accurate solution. In this particular case it chose to output data at only eight points in time between t 0 and t 10 . Let's try to plot the `solution` object \"\"\" md\"\"\" Plot recipes \"\"\" md\"\"\" Two surprising things happen. Firstly, there is no reason to expect this to have worked `solution` is some kind of Julia object, but somehow `Plots.jl` knows how to plot it. This is because `DifferentialEquations.jl` defines a plot recipe . This specifies a way to turn solution objects into plots Any package can do this relatively easily. \"\"\" md\"\"\" The second surprise is that the output looks like a smooth curve, rather than just 8 points. Let's see those points on top of the curve. We can extract the relevant data from the `solution` object \"\"\" md\"\"\" We see that the package in fact gives not only the value at those points, but it is in fact also capable of calculating an approximate solution at any intermediate point, using interpolation . In fact, we can access this by treating `solution` as if it were a function \"\"\" md\"\"\" For this particular ODE we know the analytical solution. Let's compare them as we vary the parameter p \"\"\" md\"\"\" p bind p Slider 0.0 0.1 2.0, show value true \"\"\" problem ODEProblem f, u0, time span, p solution solve problem plot solution, size 500, 300 , label \"solution\" scatter solution.t, solution.u, label \"discrete output\" begin tt 3.5 solution tt end scatter tt , solution tt , label \"t tt \", ms 5, m square let problem ODEProblem f, u0, time span, p solution solve problem plot solution, linewidth 3, xlabel \"t\", yaxis \"x t \", label \"numerical\", size 500, 300 plot t u0 exp p t , lw 3, ls dash, label \"exact\" ylims 0, 100 title \"p p\" end md\"\"\" We see that the numerical and exact solutions are to the eye indistinguishable, and that the package is fast enough to calculate the solution basically in real time. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Systems of ODEs \"\"\" md\"\"\" Now let's try to solve the SIR equations \\begin aligned \\dot s & \\beta s i \\\\ \\dot i & \\beta s i \\gamma i\\\\ \\dot r & \\gamma i \\end aligned \"\"\" md\"\"\" We need to think of the system in a vector form, \\dot \\mathbf x \\mathbf f \\mathbf p t, \\mathbf x , where the vector \\mathbf x is a vector of all the variables, \\mathbf x x 1, x 2, x 3 s, i, r the function \\mathbf f is a vector valued function \\mathbb R ^3 \\to \\mathbb R ^3 , where f k gives the right hand side of the equation for \\dot x k and the vector \\mathbf p \\beta, \\gamma is a vector of the parameters. \"\"\" x0 0.99, 0.01, 0.0 function SIR x, p, t s, i, r x unpack the vectors into scalar values β, γ p build a new vector to return return β s i, β s i γ i, γ i end md\"\"\" Now we see that the solverr has recognised that everything is a vector, and it returns a vector at each time stamp. Again we can plot \"\"\" md\"\"\" β bind β Slider 0.5 0.01 2.0, default 1.0, show value true γ bind γ Slider 0.5 0.01 2.0, default 0.1, show value true \"\"\" params β, γ SIR problem ODEProblem SIR, x0, 0.0, 50.0 , params sol solve SIR problem plot sol md\"\"\" It knows to plot each variable separately. We can instead plot combinations of variables in phase space or state space \"\"\" plot sol, idxs 1, 2 , xlabel \"s\", ylabel \"i\", arrow true, xlims 0.1, 1.0 , size 500, 300 md\"\"\" And even in 3D \"\"\" let plotly p plot sol, vars 1, 2, 3 , xlabel \"s\", ylabel \"i\", zlabel \"r\" gr p end md\"\"\" The ModelingToolkit.jl https mtk.sciml.ai stable tutorials ode modeling library provides ways to make creating ODE models more intuitive, using symbolic equation objects. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Making objects into callable functions \"\"\" md\"\"\" One of the interesting things we have seen is the way that the `solution` object can be called using the normal syntax for calling functions \"\"\" solution 3.5 md\"\"\" Not all types allow this. For example, if we define a matrix \"\"\" A rand 2, 2 md\"\"\" we cannot usually call it with a vector \"\"\" A rand 2 md\"\"\" If we wanted to do so, we could, however, using the following syntax \"\"\" A Matrix x A x md\"\"\" Note that this makes objects instances of the type callable, rather than the type itself, which we can already call as a constructor to create objects of that type \"\"\" Matrix 1 2 3 4 md\"\"\" For example, if we wanted to write our own type to store the output of the Euler method, we could do something like \"\"\" begin struct SimpleEulerOutput times Vector Float64 values Vector Float64 end function soln SimpleEulerOutput t use interpolation to calculate the value at time t using `soln.times` and `soln.values` end end md\"\"\" The definition of the function makes it callable. This says that \"the way to call an object called `soln`, of type `EulerOutput`, is the following \". Note that inside the function you will need to access the `times` and `values` from inside the `soln` object, using `soln.times` and `soln.values`. Note that at the time of writing, Pluto requires that you put this call definition in the same cell as the type definition. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Digging into objects \"\"\" md\"\"\" A key feature of the `DifferentialEquations.jl` library, and of most other libraries in Julia, is the way they define and use new types . As we have seen previously, we can define new types using `struct` which store data, and then define functions which act on those types. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's start by looking at the `ODEProblem` type \"\"\" problem md\"\"\" To see what fields, or attributes, the object contains we can use \"\"\" fieldnames typeof problem md\"\"\" In Pluto and other interactive environments we can get the same information using `problem. TAB `, i.e. by typing the TAB key after `problem.` \"\"\" md\"\"\" As usual we can extract the data contained in the object as usual using `.` \"\"\" problem.u0 problem.tspan md\"\"\" To see everything contained in the object, we can use `dump` \"\"\" dump problem md\"\"\" This seems much more complicated than you might expect. The library is clearly doing more than just storing the data that we provide in a type The main thing that has happened is that the function we passed in has been processed by wrapping it into yet another type, `ODEFunction`. This contains information such as how to calculate the derivative of the function that can be provided for more advanced usage of the package. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Similarly we can look inside the solution object \"\"\" fieldnames typeof solution dump solution md\"\"\" The solution is even more complicated, containing not only the data that was calculated, but also all information about which algorithms were used to solve the problem and tables of coefficients for interpolation. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Parameterized types \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's look now at the type of the DiffEq objects \"\"\" typeof problem md\"\"\" We see that indeed `problem` is an object of type `ODEProblem`, but that it also has several type parameters , which are listed inside the curly braces ` ` and ` ` \"\"\" typeof problem .parameters... md\"\"\" For example, we see that the second type parameter is of type `Tuple Float64, Float64 `, which is the type of the variable `time span` \"\"\" typeof time span md\"\"\" One of the reasons for using parameterized types like this is for efficiency Julia is fastest when it knows the exact types of every variable, since then it can generate efficient machine code. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Making parameterized types \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's see how and why we would make a parameterized type. Let's think again about the `EulerOutput` type that we started to write above. What happens if, as in the `DifferentialEquations.jl` library, we would like to handle both scalar ODEs one single real dependent variable , and vector ODEs? We can no longer specify that the output type is a `Vector Float64 `, so we would need to leave it unspecified \"\"\" struct SimpleEulerOutput2 times values end md\"\"\" However, it turns out that we then lose efficiency speed . What we would need is two different types one in which we specify the type of `values` as `Vector Float64 `, and the other as `Vector Vector Float64 `. Julia provides a mechanism to define both at once this is what parameterized types do \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's define our own `MyODEProblem` type as a simple example. We specify type parameters for each variable \"\"\" struct MyODEProblem T,U t0 T tfinal T u0 U end md\"\"\" Note that the starting and final times have been specified to require the same type `T`. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Now if we create objects of this type, we see that Julia matches the types we pass in to the correct type parameters \"\"\" newprob MyODEProblem 3, 4, 100.0 newprob.t0 newprob.tfinal newprob.u0 md\"\"\" If we change the types of the inputs, the type parameters change \"\"\" MyODEProblem 3.0, 4.0, 100.0 md\"\"\" If we mix types for the first two arguments then we get an error, since Julia can't match to a single type `T` \"\"\" MyODEProblem 3.0, 5, 100.0 md\"\"\" We can use vectors \"\"\" MyODEProblem 3, 4, 17.0, 18.0 "},{"url":"climate_science/optimization_with_JuMP/","title":"Solving inverse problems","tags":["lecture","module3","optimization","JuMP","track_math","track_climate","track_julia","modeling","plotting"],"text":" A Pluto.jl notebook v0.19.45 frontmatter chapter 3 video \"https www.youtube.com watch?v nm86 hDwYTU\" image \"https user images.githubusercontent.com 6933510 136200827 89647ae8 cb06 42ea a18d 5f64e9cc2b25.png\" section 11 order 11 title \"Solving inverse problems\" layout \"layout.jlhtml\" youtube id \"nm86 hDwYTU\" description \"\" tags \"lecture\", \"module3\", \"optimization\", \"JuMP\", \"track math\", \"track climate\", \"track julia\", \"modeling\", \"plotting\" using Markdown using InteractiveUtils This Pluto notebook uses bind for interactivity.

We should be able to predict that using observations about the current state of the atmosphere and mathematical models in the form of partial differential equations that predict how the wind will move the air around, what the temperature will be, and how much water can precipitate out. What about predicting rain next week? Next year? We know from experience that we can only predict the weather in the short term, up to a week or so and still only with a certain probability . Predicting even one month out doesn't seem possible. On the other hand, we can talk about the climate and how it behaves on much longer time scales, e.g. \"the average temperature in in Boston in April is 55°F\". The short term weather has a significant random or apparently random component, but becomes much more predictable when we look at statistical properties like averages and standard deviations this is then called climate . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Nonlinear dynamics stability and bifurcations \"\"\" md\"\"\" In this notebook we will see that the simplest possible model of the weather, a set of 3 coupled, nonlinear ODEs known as the Lorenz equations , can have unpredictable behaviour, known as deterministic chaos . We will build up to that by looking at two simpler models of dynamics, in 1D and 2D. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Reminder Ordinary Differential Equations ODEs \"\"\" md\"\"\" Recall that we are looking at differential equations , with the goal of modelling the evolution in time of the climate. The simplest such models are ordinary differential equations ODEs , where one or a few continuous variables evolve continuously in time, with a model that specifies their instantaneous rate of change as a function of their current values. The general form of an ODE that does not depend explicitly on time, i.e. that is autonomous , is \\frac dx t dt f x t , or \\dot x t f x t , with an initial condition x t 0 x 0 . Here \\dot x t denotes the derivative of the function t \\mapsto x t at time t . \"\"\" md\"\"\" We have seen that the simplest numerical method to solve such an equation is the forward Euler method , in which we convert this equation into an explicit time stepping routine we take a small time step of length h and approximate the derivative as \\frac dx t dt \\simeq \\frac x t h x t h , giving the numerical method x n 1 x n h f x n , where x n is the approximation of the true solution x t n at the n th time step t n . \"\"\" md\"\"\" 1D Modelling bacterial growth \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's use this to simulate a simple nonlinear ODE describing the dynamics of a population of bacteria. The bacteria reproduce at a rate \\lambda provided that there is sufficient food, in which case we would have \\dot x \\lambda x . But the need for enough food will put a limit on the sustainable population to a value K , sometimes called the carrying capacity . The simplest model for the combined effect of growth and saturation is as follows \\dot x \\lambda \\, x \\, K x . When x is close to 0 , the growth rate is \\lambda , but that rate decreases as x increases. This is sometimes called the logistic https en.wikipedia.org wiki Logistic function Logistic differential equation differential equation, although that name does not seem particularly helpful. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Our goal is to use computational thinking, but we will actually not be interested so much in the exact dynamics in time, but rather in the qualitative features of the behaviour of the system. For example, at long times formally t \\to \\infty does the population get arbitrarily large? Or does it, for example, oscillate around a particular value? Or does it converge to a particular size? This forms the subject of nonlinear dynamics or dynamical systems theory. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's simulate the system using the Euler method to try to guess the answer to this question. Note that there are many much more sophisticated methods for solving ODEs collected in the DifferentialEquations.jl package. We should never use the Euler method in practice, but should use a tried and tested library instead, and algorithms that provide much better accuracy in the solutions, if we are interested in faithful numerical results. \"\"\" md\"\"\" It's useful to rescale the variables to the simplest form \\dot x x \\, 1 x . We can do so by defining new adimensional space and time variables x' and t' as follows x K \\, x' , giving K \\dot x' \\lambda K \\, x' K K x' , and then t' \\lambda K \\, t , giving dx' dt' x' 1 x' . \"\"\" md\"\"\" We define a function representing the right hand side of the ODE \"\"\" logistic x x 1 x md\"\"\" Let's simulate this with the Euler method and plot the trajectory x t as a function of time t \"\"\" md\"\"\" Normally we would not choose the Euler method to calculate actual trajectories, but it is enough for our purposes of understanding the qualitative behaviour of the equations. \"\"\" md\"\"\" We see that for this particular initial condition, the solution seems to settle down to a fixed value after some time, and then remains at that value thereafter. Such a value is called a fixed point , a stationary point , or a steady state of the ODE. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Qualitative behaviour Fixed points and their stability \"\"\" gr fmt png, dpi 150, size 300, 200 gr fmt svg gr fmt png, dpi 300, size 400, 300 md\"\"\" Let's see what happens for other initial conditions \"\"\" md\"\"\" x₀ bind x0 Slider 0.9 0.001 3.0, default 0.5, show value true \"\"\" md\"\"\" To get an overview of the behaviour we can draw all the results on a single graph \"\"\" md\"\"\" We see that all the curves starting near to x 0 1.0 seem to converge to 1 at long times. If the system starts exactly at 0 then it stays there forever. However, if it starts close to 0, on either side, then it moves away from 0 on that same side of 0 starting from a negative value x becomes ever more negative. Even though negative populations have no meaning in the original interpretation as the dynamics of a population, we can still ask study the dynamics of the equation with negative initial conditions, since it may model other systems too. The special values x^ 1 1 and x^ 2 0 are called stationary points or fixed points of the differential equation. If we start at x^ i , then the derivative there is f' x^ i 0 , and hence we cannot move away from x^ i The fixed points can be found as zeros or roots of the function f , i.e. values x^ such that f x^ 0 . \"\"\" md\"\"\" We see, though, that the two types of fixed points are qualitatively different trajectories that start close to x^ 1 1 move towards x^ 1 , whereas trajectories that start close to x^ 2 0 move away from it. We say that x^ 1 is a stable fixed point and x^ 2 is an unstable fixed point . In general it is not possible to find analytical formulas for the position and stability of fixed points instead, we can use numerical root finding algorithms , for example the Newton method. There are various Julia packages with implementations of these algorithms we will use `Roots.jl`, which works well for scalar valued functions. \"\"\" md\"\"\" State space Vector field and phase portrait \"\"\" md\"\"\" If we want to find the whole trajectory for a given initial condition then we need to solve the equations, either numerically or analytically. However, we may want less information about the system, for example the long time or asymptotic dynamics. It turns out that we can obtain some information about that without explicitly solving the ODE This is the qualitative approach to studying nonlinear systems. Instead of drawing trajectories x t as a function of time t , as we did above, let's use a different graphical representation, where we draw state space or phase space This is the set \"space\" of all possible values of the dependent variables \"states\" . For the above ODE there is only a single dependent variable, x , so the state space is the real line, \\mathbb R . At each possible value of x , the ODE gives us information about the rate of change of x t at that point. Let's draw an arrow at that point, pointing in the direction that a particle placed at that point would move to the right if \\dot x 0 and to the left if \\dot x 0 . \"\"\" md\"\"\" This vector field indeed gives us a qualitative picture of the dynamics. It does not tell us how fast the dynamics will occur in each region, but it indicates what the tendency is. We have coded the fixed points according to their stability this may be calculated using the derivative evaluated at the fixed point, f' x^ , since this derivative controls the behaviour of nearby initial conditions x^ \\delta x . The unstable fixed point is shown as a green square, and the stable fixed point as a grey circle we will use this convention throughout the notebook. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Bifurcations \"\"\" md\"\"\" Now suppose that there is a parameter \\mu in the system that can be varied. For each value of \\mu we have a different ODE \\dot x f \\mu x . For example, \\dot x \\mu x^2. Let's draw the state space for each different value of \\mu \"\"\" g μ, x μ x^2 md\"\"\" μ bind λ Slider 1.0 0.05 1, show value true \"\"\" md\"\"\" Now let's collect all the vector fields into a single plot. The horizontal axis now represents the different possible values of the parameter \\mu \"\"\" md\"\"\" We see that at the critical value \\mu c 0 there is a qualitative change in behaviour of the system for \\mu c 0 there are two fixed points, whereas for \\mu c 0 there are no fixed points at all. Such a qualitative change is called a bifurcation . In this particular case the two fixed points collide in a saddle node or fold bifurcation. \"\"\" md\"\"\" 1D Bistability and hysteresis \"\"\" md\"\"\" Now let's look at the dynamics of the following system \\dot x \\mu x x^3. \"\"\" h μ, x μ x x^3 md\"\"\" Let's plot the bifurcation diagram again \"\"\" md\"\"\" We see that there is a range of values of \\mu for which there are three coexisting fixed points , two stable and one unstable. Since there are two stable fixed points in which the system can remain, we say that the system is bistable . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Now that we understand what the plots mean and the dynamics, let's plot just the fixed points x^ \\mu as a function of \\mu . Such a plot is called a bifurcation diagram \"\"\" md\"\"\" The pieces of curve are called branches . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Hysteresis \"\"\" md\"\"\" Suppose we now think about slowly varying the parameter \\mu . If we change the parameter \\mu by a little, the system is no longer at a fixed point, since the position of the fixed point moves when \\mu changes. However, the system will then relax it will follow the dynamics at the new value of \\mu , and will rapidly converge to the new fixed point nearby for that new value of \\mu . For example, starting at \\mu 2 , the system will stay on the lower black stable branch until \\mu 0.4 or so. At that point, two fixed points collide and annihilate each other After that there is no longer a fixed point nearby. However, there is another fixed point much further up that will now attract all trajectories, so the system rapidly transitions to that fixed point. Now suppose we decrease the parameter again. The system will now track the upper branch until \\mu 0.4 or so, when again it will jump back down. For each parameter value \\mu in the interval 0.4, 0.4 there is bistability , i.e. coexistence of two fixed points with the same value of \\mu together with a third, unstable fixed point that is not observable . The fact that the system tracks different stable branches depending on where we started, i.e. on the history of the dynamics, is known as hysteresis . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Hysteretic behaviour like this is found in many scientific and engineering contexts, including switches in biology, for example genetic switches, and in the historical dynamics of the earth's climate. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Slow fast systems \"\"\" md\"\"\" What are we actually doing when we let the parameter \\mu vary? Effectively we now have a system of two coupled ODEs, for example \\dot x \\mu x x^3 \\dot \\mu \\epsilon, where \\mu varies at a slow speed \\epsilon . On a time scale much shorter than 1 \\epsilon , the dynamics of x \"does not know\" that \\mu is changing, so it will converge to a fixed point x^ \\mu for the current value of \\mu . An associated term is adiabatic approximation . However, in fact \\mu does gradually change, so the value of x will effectively \"slide along\" the curve x t \\simeq x^ \\mu t , tracking the curve of fixed points as \\mu changes. Once \\mu reaches a critical value \\mu c , however, there is no longer a nearby fixed point to move to, and the vector field will move the system to rapidly transition to the far away alternative fixed point. If we now reverse the dynamics of \\mu , we slide back along the upper branch. \"\"\" md\"\"\" 2D Oscillations in chemical reactions the Brusselator model \"\"\" md\"\"\" Bifurcations are not restricted to 1D systems indeed, the dynamics can be much richer in higher dimensions.

We actually derived this global, or macroscopic, model from a microscopic stochastic model a few lectures ago. Components can fail at any moment but we'll start off by checking once per day to count the number that have failed during that day. Then we'll check several times per day. This is still a discrete model. Finally we'll see how we can turn this into a continuous model where we can talk about the number that have failed by any real time t . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Checking failures once per day integer time steps \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's call N k the average number of bulbs that are still functioning on day number k , starting from an initial number N 0 . We can find an equation for the number N k 1 that are still functioning at the end of day number k 1 by working out how many fail on day k 1 . Let's call p the probability that each bulb fails each day. For example, if 10% of the bulbs fail each day then p 0.1 . If there are 100 bulbs and 10% fail on the first day, then 10 fail, so there will be 90 remaining. In general, if a proportion p of the N k fail, in total we expect p \\, N k to fail. Hence N k 1 N k p \\, N k or N k 1 N k p N k. In this very simple model we can actually solve this recurrence relation analytically to find the number still functioning at time t N k 1 1 p N k so N k 1 p N k 1 1 p ^2 N k 2 \\cdots hence N k N 0 \\, 1 p ^k. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Checking failures n times per day \"\"\" md\"\"\" Now suppose instead we ask how many light bulbs fail in half a day. If 10% fail per day, it's natural to think that 5% fail in half a day. However, this is not quite right due to the effect of compounding as in compound interest . If 5% fail and then 5% of the remainder fail, then how many are left? \"\"\" 1 0.05 1 0.05 md\"\"\" So slightly fewer than 10% in total have failed, due to the effect of compounding. Nonetheless, the result is approximately right, so let's take that. \"\"\" md\"\"\" So let's suppose that n times a day, a proportion p n fail for example, 10% and twice a day gives 5% failing each time, approximately . Then the number remaining after the first failure check on day k is \"\"\" md\"\"\" N k \\frac 1 n \\textstyle 1 \\frac p n N k Here we have used a subscript since we are in a discrete situation. We could also have written instead N k \\textstyle \\frac 1 n . The solution at the next day is N k 1 N k \\, 1 \\textstyle \\frac p n ^n.

It thus makes sense to define a limiting object , which is what would happen if you could take smaller and smaller time steps in the right way, i.e. take the limit as n \\to \\infty . In that case we could imagine being able to calculate the average number N t of bulbs that are functioning at time t , where t can be any positive real number. \"\"\" md\"\"\" In calculus we learn ways to see that \"\"\" md\"\"\" 1 p n ^n converges to \\exp p as n \\to \\infty . \"\"\" md\"\"\" An alternative approach is to look at the time evolution in terms of differences . In a time 1 n a proportion p n decays. Here we are thinking of \\delta t 1 n as the time step between consecutive checks. If there are N t bulbs functioning at a time t and we take a small time step of general length \\delta t , a proportion p \\, \\delta t should fail, so that \"\"\" md\"\"\" N t \\delta t N t p \\, \\delta t \\, N t . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Dividing through by \\delta t we find \"\"\" md\"\"\" \\frac N t \\delta t N t \\delta t p \\, N t . \"\"\" md\"\"\" We now recognise the left hand side of the equation if we take the limit as \\delta t \\to 0 , we have exactly the definition of the derivative \\frac dN t dt . Hence, taking that limit we obtain \"\"\" md\"\"\" \\frac dN t dt p \\, N t with N 0 N 0 , the initial number. This is an ordinary differential equation it is an equation relating the value of the function N t at time t to the derivative slope of that function at that point. This relationship must hold for all t . It is not obvious that this equation even makes sense although it should do, given the way we have derived it , but in differential equations courses we see that it does make sense under some technical conditions , and uniquely specifies a function satisfying the ODE together with the initial condition. This is called an \"initial value problem\". \"\"\" md\"\"\" In this particular case, once again we are lucky enough to be able to solve this equation analytically N t is a function whose derivative is a multiple of the same function, and hence it must be exponential \"\"\" md\"\"\" N t N 0 \\exp p \\, t \"\"\" md\"\"\" This is an alternative way to define the exponential function.

You are surely familiar with models of this type modelling the spread of COVID 19, and from the homework. As in the homework, we can make a fully discrete, stochastic agent based model, where we give microscopic rules specifying how individual agents interact with one another. When we run such models with large enough systems, we observe that the results are often quite smooth. An alternative approach is to try to write down macroscopic discrete equations that describe the dynamics of averages. Often it is easier to understand the behaviour of such systems by formulating a continuous version of the model. Some people make discrete models because they're not happy with continuous models large discrete models can also be computationally wasteful. On the other hand, they can also include effects that might be more difficult to model in a continuous framework, e.g. non local effects or things that \"don't become continuous very well\". \"\"\" md\"\"\" Discrete time SIR model \"\"\" md\"\"\" First let's think about the SI model agents can be susceptible S and infectious I . A susceptible person becomes infectious when they come into contact with an infectious person, with some probability. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's call S t and I t be the number of susceptible and infectious people at time t , respectively, and let's call N the total number of people. Let's suppose that at each time step, each infectious person has the chance to interact with one other person on average . That person will be chosen at random from the total population of size N . A new infection occurs only if that chosen person is susceptible, which happens with probability S t N , and only if the infection attempt is successful, with probability b , say. Hence the change in the number of infectious people after that step is \"\"\" md\"\"\" \\Delta I t I t 1 I t b \\, I t \\, \\left \\frac S t N \\right \"\"\" md\"\"\" The decrease in S t is also given by \\Delta I t . \"\"\" md\"\"\" There is also recovery, with a constant probability c at each step, once you are infectious. It is useful to normalize by N , so we define the proportions of the population that are susceptible, infectious and recovered as s t \\frac S t N \\quad i t \\frac I t N \\quad r t \\frac R t N . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Including recovery with probability c we obtain the discrete time SIR model \"\"\" md\"\"\" \\begin align s t 1 & s t b \\, s t \\, i t \\\\ i t 1 & i t b \\, s t \\, i t c \\, i t\\\\ r t 1 & r t c \\, i t \\end align \"\"\" md\"\"\" Continuous time SIR model \"\"\" md\"\"\" We can now go through the same process as with the failure model, where we take time steps of length \\delta t instead, and replace probabilities b and c with rates \\beta and \\gamma . Taking the limit \\delta t \\to 0 we get \"\"\" md\"\"\" \\begin align \\frac ds t dt & \\beta \\, s t \\, i t \\\\ \\frac di t dt & \\beta \\, s t \\, i t & \\gamma \\, i t \\\\ \\frac dr t dt & & \\gamma \\, i t \\end align \"\"\" md\"\"\" We can think of this as a model of a chemical reaction with species S, I and R. The term s t i t is known as the mass action https en.wikipedia.org wiki Law of mass action form of interaction. Note that no analytical solutions of these simple nonlinear ODEs are known as a function of time However, parametric solutions are known https arxiv.org abs 1403.2160 . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Below is an example simulation of the discrete time model. \"\"\" begin NN 100 SS NN 1 II 1 RR 0 end ss, ii, rr SS NN, II NN, RR NN p infection, p recovery 0.1, 0.01 TT 1000 function discrete SIR s0, i0, r0, T 1000 s, i, r s0, i0, r0 results s s, i i, r r for t in 1 T Δi p infection s i Δr p recovery i s new s Δi i new i Δi Δr r new r Δr push results, s s new, i i new, r r new s, i, r s new, i new, r new end return results end SIR discrete SIR ss, ii, rr begin ts 1 length SIR discrete time SIR plot plot ts, x.s for x in SIR , m o, label \"S\", alpha 0.2, linecolor blue, leg right, size 400, 300 plot ts, x.i for x in SIR , m o, label \"I\", alpha 0.2 plot ts, x.r for x in SIR , m o, label \"R\", alpha 0.2 xlims 0, 500 end md\"\"\" Time stepping The Euler method \"\"\" md\"\"\" Above we showed how we can think of Ordinary Differential Equations ODEs as arising in a natural way from discrete time models where we take time steps. What about if somebody gives us an ODE how should we solve it numerically? In fact, we do the reverse process We discretize the equation and reduce it to a system where we take time steps Suppose the differential equation is \\dot x f x The simplest such method is the Euler method we approximate the derivative using a small but not too small time step h what we called \\delta t above \\dot x \\simeq \\frac x t h x t h giving x t \\delta t \\simeq x t h \\, f x . The Euler method with constant time step is then the following algorithm x k 1 x k h \\, f x k If we have several variables in our ODE, we can wrap the variables up into a vector and use the same method for the ODE \\dot \\mathbf x \\mathbf f \\mathbf x the Euler method becomes \\mathbf x k 1 \\mathbf x k h \\, \\mathbf f \\mathbf x k , where \\mathbf f denotes is a vector valued function mapping the vector of variables to the vector of right hand sides of the ODEs. \"\"\" md\"\"\" However, in general the Euler method is not a good algorithm to simulate the dynamics of an ODE We can see why that might be from the graphs at the start of this notebook taking time steps like this actually does a bad job at approximating the continuous curve. Numerical analysis courses show how to design better numerical methods to approximate the true solution of an ODE more accurately. The Julia SciML DifferentialEquations.jl https diffeq.sciml.ai stable tutorials ode example ecosystem provides a large suite of methods for solving ODEs and many other types of differential equations using state of the art methods. \"\"\" "},{"url":"data_science/discrete_and_continuous/","title":"Discrete and Continuous","tags":["lecture","module2","track_math","discrete","continuous"],"text":" A Pluto.jl notebook v0.19.45 frontmatter chapter 2 video \"https www.youtube.com watch?v H6Dcx3YeTkE\" image \"https user images.githubusercontent.com 6933510 136196552 ce16c06f bd12 427f 80e5 aedb1fbc734a.png\" section 7 order 7 title \"Discrete and Continuous\" layout \"layout.jlhtml\" youtube id \"H6Dcx3YeTkE\" description \"\" tags \"lecture\", \"module2\", \"track math\", \"discrete\", \"continuous\" using Markdown using InteractiveUtils This Pluto notebook uses bind for interactivity.

The fact of the matter is that there are limits that give the same answer no matter how you get there, and these limits are important to us. For example, no matter how you cover an area, by little rectangles, the sum always converges to what we intuitively call area. The normal distribution is interesting in that no matter which starting finite distribution we might take, if add n independent copies and normalize to variance 1 we get the same limit. Again, there are so many ways to start, and yet we always end up with the same thing. Continuous mathematics is full of so many examples, where discrete objects end up behaving the same. Indeed what happens as discrete objects get larger and larger, their complexity gets out of control if one wants to keep track of every detail, but they get simpler in their aggregate behavior. \"\"\" f x,t exp x^2 t √ π t bind t Slider .01 .01 8, show value true begin x 3 .01 3 plot x, f. x,t , ylims 0,1 , legend false end begin surface 2 .05 2, .2 .01 1, f, alpha .4, c Reds, legend false for t .2 .1 1 plot 2 .05 2, fill t,length 2 .05 2 , f. 2 .05 2,t , c black end xlabel \"x\" ylabel \"t\" plot end plotly md\"\"\" Sum and a Definite Integral \"\"\" md\"\"\" Cumsum and an Indefinite Integral \"\"\" md\"\"\" Discrete Finite Differencing Filters and Derivatives Gradients \"\"\" md\"\"\" Discrete and continuous convolutions e.g. probability densities \"\"\" md\"\"\" Discrete Random Walks and Brownian Motion \"\"\" md\"\"\" Binomial Distribution and the Normal Distribution \"\"\" md\"\"\" Discrete and the Continuous Fourier Transform \"\"\" P binomial n,k for n 0 5,k 0 5 P P' begin A 1 . beta. 1 6 ', 0 5 . 1 1 5 A 1, . 1 round.

This method tries to answer the questions \"which 'directions' are the most important in the data\" and \"can we reduce the dimensionality https en.wikipedia.org wiki Dimensionality reduction number of useful variables of the data\"? This can be viewed as another take on the question of finding and exploiting structure in data. It also leads towards ideas of machine learning . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Rank of a matrix \"\"\" md\" Flags\" md\"Let's start off by recalling ideas about multiplication tables or outer products \" outer v, w x y for x in v, y in w outer 1 10, 1 12 md\"\"\" Each column is a multiple in general not an integer multiple of any other column and each row is a multiple of any other row. This is an example of a structured matrix , i.e. one in which we need to store less information to store the matrix than the full m \\times n table of numbers even though no element is 0 . For example, for an outer product we only need m n numbers, which is usually much less. \"\"\" md\"Some flags give simple examples of outer products, for example\" flag outer 1, 0.1, 2 , ones 6 ones 6 flag2 outer 1, 0.1, 2 , 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3 md\"\"\" Note that outer products are not always immediate to recognise just by looking at an image But you should be able to recognise that there is some kind of structure. \"\"\" md\" Matrix rank\" md\"\"\" If a matrix can be written exactly as a single multiplication table outer product, we say that its rank is 1, and we call it a rank 1 matrix. Similarly, if it can be written as the sum of two outer products, it has rank 2 , etc. \"\"\" md\"Let's see what a random rank 1 matrix looks like \" w 300 image outer 1 0.4 rand 50 , rand w md\"\"\" It has a characteristic checkerboard or patchwork look. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Here's a random rank 2 matrix \"\"\" md\"\"\" We see that it starts to look less regular. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise Make an interactive visualisation of a random rank n matrix where you can vary n . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Effect of noise \"\"\" md\"\"\" Now what happens if we add a bit of noise , i.e. randomness, to a rank 1 matrix? \"\"\" noisy image image . 0.03 . randn. md\"\"\"The noisy image now has a rank larger than 1. But visually we can see that it is \"close to\" the original rank 1 matrix. Given this matrix, how could we discover that it is close to a structured, rank 1 matrix? We would like to be able to find this out and say that the matrix is close to a simple one.\"\"\" md\" Images as data\" md\"\"\" Now let's treat the image as a data matrix , so that each column of the image matrix is a vector representing one observation of data. In data science it is often the rows that correspond to observations. Let's try to visualize those vectors, taking just the first two rows of the image as the x and y coordinates of our data points \"\"\" image 1 2, 1 20 begin xx image 1, yy image 2, end md\" From images to data\" md\"\"\" We would like to visualise this data with the `Plots.jl` package, passing it the x and y coordinates as arguments and plotting a point at each x i, y i pair. We obtain the following plot of the original rank 1 matrix and the noisy version \"\"\" gr begin xs noisy image 1, ys noisy image 2, scatter xs, ys, label \"noisy\", m ., alpha 0.3, ms 4, ratio 1 scatter xx, yy, leg topleft, label \"rank 1\", ms 3, alpha 0.3, size 500, 400 , m square, c red, framestyle origin title \"Plotting a rank 1 matrix gives a straight line \" end md\"We see that the exact rank 1 matrix has columns that lie along a line through the origin in this representation, since they are just multiples of one another. E.g. If x 1, y 1 and x 2, y 2 are two columns with x 2 cx 1 and y 2 cy 1 , then y 2 x 2 y 1 x 1 , so they lie along the same line through the origin. The approximate rank 1 matrix has columns that lie close to the line \" md\"So, given the data, we want to look at it do see if it lies close to a line or not. How can we do so in an automatic way? \" md\"\"\" Measuring data cloud \"size\" using statistics \"\"\" md\"Looking at this cloud of data points, a natural thing to do is to try to measure it How wide is it, and how tall?\" md\"\"\"For example, let's think about calculating the width of the cloud, i.e. the range of possible x values of the data. For this purpose the y values are actually irrelevant. \"\"\" md\"\"\" A natural idea would be to just scan the data and take the maximum and minimum values. However, real data often contains anomalously large values called outliers , which would dramatically affect this calculation. Instead we need to use a statistical method where we weight the data and average over all the data points. This process will hopefully be affected less by outliers, and will give a more representative idea of the size of the bulk of the data. \"\"\" md\"\"\" A first step in analysing data is often to centre it data around 0 by subtracting the mean, sometimes called \"de meaning\" \"\"\" begin xs centered xs . mean xs ys centered ys . mean ys end scatter xs centered, ys centered, ms 5, alpha 0.5, ratio 1, leg false, framestyle origin md\"\"\" Measuring a \"width\" of a data set \"\"\" md\"\"\" A natural way to measure the width of a data set could be to measure some kind of width separately in both the x and y directions, in other words by projecting the data onto one of the axes, while ignoring the other one. Let's start with the x coordinates of the centred data and try to average them. If we literally average them we will get 0 since we have subtracted the mean . We could ask \"on average how far away from the origin is the data\".

However, there is another measure which is easier to reason about theoretically analytically \"\"\" md\"\"\" Root mean square distance Standard deviation \"\"\" md\"\"\" The standard deviation is the root mean square distance of the centered data from the origin. In other words, we first square the distances or displacements from the origin, then take the mean of those, giving the variance . However, since we have squared the original distances, this gives a quantity with units \"distance ^2 \", so we need to take the square root to get back to a measurable length \"\"\" begin σ x √ mean xs centered.^2 root mean square distance from 0 σ y √ mean ys centered.^2 end md\"This gives the following approximate extents standard deviations of the cloud \" begin scatter xs centered, ys centered, ms 5, alpha 0.5, ratio 1, leg false, framestyle origin vline 2 σ x, 2 σ x , ls dash, lw 2, c green hline 2 σ y, 2 σ y , ls dash, lw 2, c blue annotate 2σ x 0.93, 0.03, text L\"2\\sigma x\", 14, green annotate 2σ x 0.88, 0.03, text L\" 2\\sigma x\", 14, green annotate 0.05, 2σ y 1.13, text L\"2\\sigma y\", 14, blue annotate 0.06, 2σ y 1.14, text L\" 2\\sigma y\", 14, blue end md\"\"\" We expect most around 95% of the data to be contained within the interval \\mu \\pm 2 \\sigma , where \\mu is the mean and \\sigma is the standard deviation. This assumes that the data is normally distributed , which is not actually the case for the data generated above. \"\"\" md\" Correlated data\" md\"\"\" However, from the figure it is clear that x and y are not the \"correct directions\" to use for this data set. It would be more natural to think about other directions the direction in which the data set is mainly pointing roughly, the direction in which it's longest , together with the approximately perpendicular direction in which it is narrowest. We need to find from the data which directions these are, and the extent width of the data cloud in those directions. However, we cannot obtain any information about those directions by looking separately at x coordinates and y coordinates, since within the same bounding boxes that we just calculated the data can be distributed in many different ways. Rather, the information that we need is encoded in the relationship between the values of x i and y i for the points in the data set . For our data set, when x is large and negative, y is also rather negative when x is 0, y is near 0 , and when x is large and positive, so is y . We say that x and y are correlated literally they are mutually \"co\" related, such that knowing some information about one of them allows us to predict something about the other. For example, if I measure a new data point from the same process and I find that x is around 0.25 then I would expect y to be within the range 0.05 to 0.2 , and it would be very surprising if y were 0.5. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Although there are standard methods to calculate this correlation, we prefer to hone our intuition using computational thinking instead \"\"\" md\"\"\" We want to think about different directions , so let's introduce an angle \\theta to describe the direction along which we are looking. We want to calculate the width of the cloud along that direction . Effectively we are changing coordinates to a new coordinate, oriented along the line. To do this requires more linear algebra than we are assuming in this course, but let's see what it looks like \"\"\" md\" Rotating the axes\" md\"\"\"By rotating the axes we can \"look in different directions\" and calculate the width of the data set \"along that direction\".

This is often called the first principal component in statistics, or the first singular vector in linear algebra. We can also now quantify how close the data is to lying along that single line, using the width in the perpendicular direction if that width is \"much smaller\" than the width in the first principal direction then the data is close to being rank 1. \"\"\" md\"The simplest way to maximise this function is to evaluate it everywhere and find one of the places where it takes the maximum value \" begin θs 0 0.01 2π fs variance. θs θmax θs argmax fs θmin θs argmin fs fmax variance θmax fmin variance θmin end begin scatter xs centered, ys centered, ms 5, alpha 0.3, ratio 1, leg false, framestyle origin plot 0, 0 , 2 sqrt fmax . cos θmax , sin θmax , arrow true, lw 3, c red plot 0, 0 , 2 sqrt fmin . cos θmin , sin θmin , arrow true, lw 3, c red end md\"\"\" Note that the directions that maximise and minimise variance are perpendicular. This is always the case, as shown using the Singular Value Decomposition SVD in linear algebra. There are different ways to think about this procedure. We can think of it as effectively \"fitting an ellipse\" to the data, where the widths of the ellipse axes show the relative importance of each direction in the data. Alternatively we can think of it as fitting a multivariate normal distribution by finding a suitable covariance matrix. \"\"\" begin circle cos. θs sin. θs ' stretch 2 sqrt fmax 0 0 2 sqrt fmin ellipse R θmax stretch circle plot ellipse 1, , ellipse 2, , series shape, alpha 0.4, fill true, c orange end md\"\"\" Note also that an ellipse is the image of the unit circle under a linear transformation. We are effectively learning what the best linear transformation is that transforms the unit circle into our data cloud. \"\"\" md\" Higher dimensions\" md\"\"\" Can we generalise this to dimensions higher than 2? Let's think about 3D. If we take columns of the first three rows of the original image, we have vectors in 3D. If we plot these vectors in 3D, a rank 1 matrix will give a straight line in 3D, while a rank 2 matrix will give a plane in 3D. Rank 2 noise gives a noisy cloud lying close to a plane. Similarly to what we did above, we need to calculate the ellipsoid that best fits the data. The widths of the axes of the ellipsoid tell us how close to being a line or a plane rank 1 or rank 2 the data is. \"\"\" md\"In more than 3D we can no longer visualise the data, but the same idea applies. The calculations are done using the SVD. If the widths of the ellipsoid in some directions are very small, we can ignore those directions and hence reduce the dimensionality of the data, by changing coordinates to the principal components.\" md\"\"\" What is the Singular Value Decomposition SVD ? \"\"\" md\"\"\" The Singular Value Decomposition SVD is a way of writing any matrix in terms of simpler matrices. Thinking in terms of linear transformations, any linear transformation T has the same effect as a sequence of three simple transformations T rotation₂ ∘ stretch ∘ rotation₁ In terms of matrices, for any matrix M it is possible to write M U \\, \\Sigma \\, V^\\text T where U and V are orthogonal matrices, i.e. they satisfy U U^\\text T I and V V^\\text T I , and \\Sigma is a diagonal matrix. Orthogonal matrices have determinant \\pm 1 , so they leave areas unchanged. They are rotations, possibly combined with reflections. There are algorithms from numerical linear algebra to calculate this decomposition. In Julia we call the `svd` function, e.g. \"\"\" let M 2 1 1 1 svd M end md\"\"\" Let's look at the action of the matrix on the unit disc.

But we would be thrilled if you see it rather as a more general discussion on software engineering and abstractions, since the principles involved extend to many different contexts. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Random variables \"\"\" md\"\"\" Recall that a random variable X is an object which has different possible outcomes x , to which we assign probabilities \\mathbb P X x . The correspondence of probabilities to outcomes is called the probability distribution of the random variable. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Gaussian distributions \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's remind ourselves of a very important type of distribution, namely the Gaussian distribution with mean \\mu and standard deviation \\sigma or variance \\sigma^2 . We can sample from a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance 1 with the `randn` function short for \"random normal\" . We can then shift and scale to get the Gaussian distribution that we want \"\"\" md\"\"\" μ bind μ Slider 3 0.01 3, show value true, default 0.0 σ bind σ Slider 0.01 0.01 3, show value true, default 1.0 \"\"\" bell curve x exp x^2 2 √ 2π bell curve x, μ, σ bell curve x μ σ σ bell curve 0, 3, 2 md\"\"\" Sum of two Gaussians \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's try to add two Gaussians. From the empirical experimental point of view the sum of two random variables is easy to compute Just sample both of them and add the resulting values to get the value of the random variable that is their sum \"\"\" md\"\"\" We see that we get back a Gaussian again In fact, the sum of two Gaussians with means \\mu 1 and \\mu 2 , and variances \\sigma 1^2 and \\sigma 2^2 , is a Gaussian again with mean \\mu 1 \\mu 2 and variance \\sigma 1^2 \\sigma 2^2 . Below we will see how to encode this fact computationally. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Theoretical random variables vs. sampling What should a theoretical random variable be able to do? What should we be able to do with sampling? Naming , e.g. `Gaussian` Parameters , e.g. \\mu and \\sigma^2 Theoretical Theoretical mean Theoretical variance Theoretical sum of two random variables Theoretical product of two random variables Probability distribution Sampling Sample a random variable Sample mean Sample variance Sample sum Histogram \"\"\" md\"\"\" Why define a type at all? \"\"\" md\"\"\" How can we represent a random variable in software? In some languages there are different names for the various functions associated to a random variable, but no name for the random variable itself For example, in R there is a standard naming convention in R, with `d` for density, etc., followed by the name like `norm` for normal. The indicators are `d` for the density `p` for the distribution function `q` for the quantile function `r` for generating random variates See e.g. Normal distribution in R https www.rdocumentation.org packages stats versions 3.6.2 topics Normal Chi squared distribution in R https www.rdocumentation.org packages stats versions 3.6.2 topics Chisquare What's wrong with this? All these functions are referring to an underlying random variable or probability distribution , which you will find in any course in probability, and yet there's no way to refer to the underlying mathematical object \"\"\" md\"\"\" Instead, we would like to be able to refer to the random variable or probability distribution itself. We should be able to provide a type with the name and parameters of a random variable, but not yet specify how to generate random instances variates ? It turns out that this is a very good example of thinking ahead by providing an abstraction . We can later provide a means for random sampling and even, if a new algorithm comes along that is more efficient, we can replace it some day \"\"\" md\"\"\" Defining abstract types for random variables \"\"\" md\"\"\" We define an abstract type using `abstract type Name end`, where ` Name ` is replaced with the name of the type. We can think of an abstract type as being a collection of types that share a particular property. In our case, we want to create a type to represent \"any random variable\", and also the sub types \"any continuous valued random variable\" and \"any discrete valued random variable\". This will allow us to specify later on whether a given concrete i.e. particular random variable is discrete or continuous. We use ` ` to denote sub type \"\"\" begin abstract type RandomVariable end abstract type DiscreteRandomVariable RandomVariable end abstract type ContinuousRandomVariable RandomVariable end end md\"\"\" Defining a type for a Gaussian random variable \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's start off by looking at Gaussian random variables, also called normal random variables.

But, thinking ahead, this is true for any random variable, so we can define it to act on any random variable that we will define later \"\"\" md\"\"\" This is an example of good software design. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Sum of two Gaussian random variables \"\"\" md\"\"\" Gaussians have a special property the sum of two Gaussians is always a Gaussian. We say that Gaussians are stable distributions there are others https en.wikipedia.org wiki Stable distribution . Note that we don't need random samples for this theoretical observation, embodied in the following code \"\"\" Base.

The possible range of outcomes is called the support of the distribution. For a Gaussian it is the whole real line, \\infty, \\infty . \"\"\" md\"\"\" One way to specify a continuous random variable X is via its probability density function , or PDF , f X .

There are two routes we could go We could use the known theoretical sum, or we could write a general purpose tool. Let's do the latter. \"\"\" md\"\"\" When we add two Bernoulli random variables we do not get a Bernoulli back. To see this it's enough to observe that the sum can have the outcome 2, which is impossible for a Bernoulli. So the result is just the random variable \"the sum of these two given random variables\". In general it won't even have a common name. So we actually need to define a new type to represent the \"sum of two given random variables\", which itself will be a random variable \"\"\" struct SumOfTwoRandomVariables RandomVariable X1 RandomVariable X2 RandomVariable end begin B1 Bernoulli 0.25 B2 Bernoulli 0.6 end md\"\"\" Now we can define the sum of two random variables of any type \"\"\" Base.

Why should we model with random processes? Either we need to get a lot of data to precisely characterise a system, or we assume it's random It may well be that can have all the details, but by making a simplifying assumption we actually gain more understanding . Examples Stock price going up and down Pollutants getting dispersed in the air Neutral genes moving through a population \"\"\" md\"\"\" Simple random walk The simplest version is called simple random walk one object jumps on the integers at each time step it jumps left or right. Each such step is a new random variable, taking values \\pm 1 at each step, each with probability 1 2 in the simplest case . We can think of this as a scaling of a Bernoulli random variable. In order to simulate this, we need to know how to generate the jumps. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Julia Benchmarking \"\"\" md\"\"\" There are various ways we could generate random values \\pm 1 . Let's use this as an opportunity to learn about benchmarking in Julia, i.e. measuring run time to compare performance. In this case we will do \"micro benchmarks\", which try to compare tiny pieces of code which we intend to run many millions of times, so that small differences in run time can be significant. The `BenchmarkTools.jl` package provides relatively easy to use tools for measuring this, by running the code many times and calculating statistics. The ` btime` macro is a simple way to estimate actual running time. Each option should be enclosed in a function. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Here are a few different ways we could generate random steps \"\"\" begin step1 rand 1, 1 step2 2 rand 0.5 1 step3 2 rand Bool 1 step4 sign randn end with terminal do btime step1 btime step2 btime step3 btime step4 end md\"\"\" Trajectory of a random walk \"\"\" md\"\"\" We can now calculate the trajectory of a 1D random walk as it takes several steps.

Often each X i will be independent random variables of the same type, in which case we talk about an independent and identically distributed IID collection. In principle we could use the method from last lecture to model this, but there is a difficulty since we are interested in all intermediate steps The values S n 1 and S n , for example, are not independent even though the X i are . For example, if S n 1 is large, then S n is also about as large, so they are highly correlated. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Cumulative sum \"\"\" md\"\"\" Suppose we generate steps X i , e.g. \"\"\" steps rand 1, 1 , 10 md\"\"\" The trajectory, or sample path, of the random walk, is the collection of positions over time.

We can think of this as the equivalent of sampling using `rand`. Suppose that we were to conceptually run millions or billions of trajectories of our random walk. At each time step, we can ask for the probability distribution in space , averaged over all those walks. Note that we now have two variables. We could do this by literally running many walks and computing histograms. Instead we can look at how probabilities move around. Let's call p i^t the probability of being at site i at time t . We can then ask what the probability of being at site i at time t 1 . It must have been in one of the neighbouring sites at time t , so p i^ t 1 \\textstyle \\frac 1 2 p i 1 ^ t p i 1 ^ t .

That's not how we learnt to build Pascal's triangle at school We learned to build each number up by summing two adjacent numbers from the previous row . In the lower triangular representation we we sum the number immediately above with the one to the left of it. \"\"\" md\"\"\" We can think of this as... a convolution with the vector 1, 1 Recall that convolutions like this are used as image filters , where we want to apply the same local operation everywhere along a vector i.e. one in which we modify a vector in a neighbourhood . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Random walks Independent and identically distributed random variables \"\"\" md\"\"\" The discussion of Pascal's triangle and convolutions will surprisingly turn up below. For now let's go back to thinking about random walks . Recall that in a random walk, at each tick of a clock we take a step in space, say left or right. Each spatial step is random, so we can think of each step as being a random variable with a certain probability distribution, for example the random variable that takes the value 1 with probability \\frac 1 2 and 1 also with probability \\frac 1 2 . Often we will think about random walks in which each step is \"the same\". What do we mean by \"the same\"? We don't mean that the outcome is the same, but rather that each step has the same probability distribution , i.e. the same probability of taking each possible value. In other words, each step is given by copies of the same random variable . Steps are also independent of each other the choice of step direction right now does not affect the choice at the next step . Hence the steps form a collection of independent and identically distributed random variables , or IID random variables. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Random walks as a cumulative sum \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's call the random variable that describes the i th step X i . Then the overall position S n of the random walk at time n is given by S n X 1 \\cdots X n \\sum i 1 ^n X i. Here we have taken the initial position S 0 equal to 0. If the initial position is not zero, then this instead gives the displacement S n S 0 at time n . Recall that by the sum of two random variables we mean a new random variable whose outcomes are sums of the outcomes, with probabilities given by taking the possible pairs of outcomes giving each new outcome. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Cumulative sum \"\"\" md\"\"\" We previously looked at sums like this. The difference now is that we are interested in the entire trajectory , i.e. the sequence S 1 , S 2 , \\ldots , S n , \\ldots . The trajectory is given by partial sums \"\"\" md\"\"\" \\begin align S 1 & X 1 \\\\ S 2 & X 1 X 2 \\\\ S 3 & X 1 X 2 X 3 \\end align etc. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Note that S n 1 is not independent of S n or the other S m . E.g. if S 100 happens to be large, then S 101 will be about as large. Thinking about types, as we did a couple of lectures ago, we would need to define a new type to represent a random walk, since we cannot generate consecutive values as independent samples. \"\"\" md\"\"\" How could we calculate a trajectory of a walk? Suppose we generate steps X i , e.g. \"\"\" steps rand 1, 1 , 10 md\"\"\" The whole trajectory is given by the cumulative sum also called \"prefix sum\" or \"scan\". Julia has the function `cumsum` to calculate this \"\"\" cumsum 1, 2, 3, 4 md\"\"\" So the trajectory is given by \"\"\" cumsum steps plot cumsum steps , m o, leg false, size 500, 300 md\"\"\" Note that in Julia this is just a convenience function it will be no more performant than writing the `for` loop yourself unlike in some other languages, where `for` loops are slow . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Evolving probability distributions in time \"\"\" md\"\"\" So far we have looked at single trajectories of random walks. We can think of this as the equivalent of sampling using `rand`. Suppose that we run many trajectories of a random walk. At a given time t we can ask where all of the walks are by taking a histogram of the S t^ k , where the superscript ^ k denotes the k th trajectory out of the collection. Doing so gives us the probability distribution of the random variable S t . Let's call p i^t \\mathbb P S t i the probability of being at site i at time t . Then the probability distribution at time t is given by the collection of all the p i^t we can group these into a vector \\mathbf p ^t . Now we can ask what happens at the next time step t 1 . Taking histograms again gives the probabilities p j^ t 1 and the vector \\mathbf p ^t of all of them. But \\mathbf p ^ t 1 and \\mathbf p ^ t are related in some way, since we go from S t to S t 1 by just taking a single step. Let's think about the case of a simple random walk in one dimension. To arrive at site i at time t 1 , we must have been in one of the neighbouring sites at time t and jumped with probability \\frac 1 2 in the direction of site i . Hence we have p i^ t 1 \\textstyle \\frac 1 2 p i 1 ^ t p i 1 ^ t . This is sometimes called the master equation even though that is rather a useless, non descriptive name it describes how the probability distribution of the random walk evolves in time . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Implementing time evolution of probabilities Let's write a function to evolve a probability vector to the next time step for a simple random walk \"\"\" function evolve p p′ similar p make a vector of the same length and type to store the probability vector at the next time step for i in 2 length p 1 iterate over the bulk of the system p′ i 0.5 p i 1 p i 1 end boundary conditions p′ 1 0 p′ end 0 return p′ end md\"\"\" Wait... Do you recognise this? This is just a convolution again The kernel is now \\frac 1 2 , 0, \\frac 1 2 . Apart from the extra 0 and the \\frac 1 2 , this is the same as in Pascal's triangle... so probabilities in simple random walk behave like Pascal's triangle \"\"\" md\"\"\" Note that just as with images we have a problem at the edges of the system We need to specify boundary conditions on the first and last cells. For now we have put 0s at the boundary, corresponding to probability escaping at the boundary any probability that arrives at the boundary at a given time step does not stay in the system. We can think of the probability as analogous to a chemical moving through a system that leaves our system and e.g. moves into the outside world when it reaches an edge. \"\"\" md\"\"\" We also need to specify an initial condition \\mathbf p 0 . This tells us where our walker is at time 0 . Suppose that all walkers start at site i 0 . We will place this in the middle of our vector. Then the probability of being at 0 is 1 certainty , while the probability at any other site is 0 impossible \"\"\" function initial condition n p₀ zeros n p₀ n ÷ 2 1 1 return p₀ end md\"\"\" Now let's evolve the probability vector in time by applying the `evolve` function repeatedly, starting from the initial probability distribution \"\"\" function time evolution p0, N ps p0 p p0 for i in 1 N p evolve p push ps, copy p end return ps end md\"\"\" Let's visualise this \"\"\" begin grid size 101 p0 initial condition grid size end ps time evolution p0, 100 md\"\"\" Note that `ps` is a `Vector`, whose elements are each `Vector`s I.e. we have a vector of vectors.

In this notebook we will see how we can start from an individual based probabilistic probabilistic model, and how sometimes we can find deterministic equations for a macroscopic system level description.

Computationally we can do the same thing by creating a new object to represent \"a Bernoulli random variable\". \"\"\" struct Bernoulli p Float64 end md\"\"\" We want to be able to sample from it, using `rand`, and take its `mean`.

Since all such random variables are the same, this represents any Bernoulli random variable with that probability. We should use this type any time we need a Bernoulli random variable. If you need this in another notebook you will either need to copy and paste the definition or, better, make your own mini library.

On average, in each sweep each infectious individual has the chance to interact with one other individual. That individual is chosen uniformly at random from the total population of size N . But a new infection occurs only if that chosen individual is susceptible, which happens with probability S t N , and then if the infection is successful, with probability b , say. Hence the change in the number of infectious people after that step is.

The square root must be between these two numbers. Why? 1. Repeat until `x a` is roughly equal to `a`. Return `a` as the square root. In general, you will never get to the point where `x a` is exactly equal to `a`. So if our algorithm keeps going until `x a a`, then it will get stuck.

Use your `mean` function \"\"\" md\"\"\" Note about mutation There are two ways to think about this exercise, you could modify the original vector, or you can create a new vector . We often prefer the second version, so that the original data is preserved. We generally only use code of the first variant in the most performance sensitive parts of a program, as it requires more care to write and use correctly. Be careful not to get carried away in optimizing code , especially when learning a new language There is a convention among Julians that functions that modify their argument have a ` ` in their name. For example, `sort x ` returns a sorted copy of `x`, while `sort x ` modifies `x` to be sorted. Tips for writing non mutating code 1. Rewriting an existing mutating function to be non mutating can feel like a 'tedious' and 'inefficient' process. Often, instead of trying to rewrite a mutating function, it's best to take a step back and try to think of your problem as constructing something new . Instead of a `for` loop, it might make more sense to use descriptive primitives like broadcasting with the dot syntax https docs.julialang.org en v1 manual functions man vectorized also for math operators https docs.julialang.org en v1 manual mathematical operations man dot operators , and map and filter https www.youtube.com watch?v O HBDZMLrM . 2. If a mutating algorithm makes the most sense for your problem, then you can first use `copy` to create a copy of an array, and then modify that copy. We will cover this topic more in the later exercises \"\"\" function demean xs your code here return missing end test vect let feel free to change your test case here to create 1.0, 1.5, 8.5 this cell is a bit funky to deal with a common pitfall from last year it regenerates the vector if you accidentally wrote a mutating function don't worry about how it works for this exercise demean to create end md\"To verify our function, let's check that the mean of the `demean test vect ` is 0 Due to floating point round off error it may not be exactly 0. \" demeaned test vect demean test vect mean demeaned test vect md\"\"\" Exercise 1.5 👉 Generate a vector of 100 elements.

The result should be a 2D array of numbers . Use your function `get red` from the previous exercise. \"\"\" function get reds image AbstractMatrix your code here return missing end get reds philip head md\"\"\" Great By extracting the red channel value of each pixel, we get a 2D array of numbers. We went from an image 2D array of RGB colors to a matrix 2D array of numbers . Exercise 2.3 Let's try to visualize this matrix. Right now, it is displayed in text form, but because the image is quite large, most rows and columns don't fit on the screen. Instead, a better way to visualize it is to view a number matrix as an image . This is easier than you might think We just want to map each number to an `RGB` object, and the result will be a 2D array of `RGB` objects, which Julia will display as an image. First, let's define a function that turns a number into a color . \"\"\" function value as color x return RGB x, 0, 0 end value as color 0.0 , value as color 0.6 , value as color 1.0 md\"\"\" 👉 Use the functions `get reds` and `value as color` to visualize the red channel values of `philip head`.

Use it to write a function `quantize x Number ` that takes in a value x which you can assume is between 0 and 1 and \"quantizes\" it into bins of width 0.1. For example, check that 0.267 gets mapped to 0.2. \"\"\" function quantize x Number your code here return missing end md\"\"\" Intermezzo multiple methods In Julia, we often write multiple methods for the same function. When a function is called, the method is chosen based on the input arguments. Let's look at an example These are two methods to the same function, because they have the same name, but different input types \"\"\" function double x Number return x 2 end function double x Vector return x..., x... end md\"\"\" When we call the function `double`, Julia will decide which method to call based on the given input argument \"\"\" double 24 double 1,2,37 md\"\"\" We call this multiple dispatch , and it is one of Julia's key features. Throughout this course, you will see lots of real world application, and learn to use multiple dispatch to create flexible and readable abstractions \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 3.3 👉 Write the second method of the function `quantize`, i.e. a new version of the function with the same name. This method will accept a color object called `color`, of the type `AbstractRGB`. Here, ` AbstractRGB` is a type annotation . This ensures that this version of the function will be chosen when passing in an object whose type is a subtype of the `AbstractRGB` abstract type. For example, both the `RGB` and `RGBX` types satisfy this. The method you write should return a new `RGB` object, in which each component r , g and b are quantized. Use your previous method for `quantize` \"\"\" function quantize color AbstractRGB your code here return missing end md\"\"\" Exercise 3.4 👉 Write a method `quantize image AbstractMatrix ` that quantizes an image by quantizing each pixel in the image.

If the result falls outside the range 0, 1 you should \"clamp\" it to that range. Julia has a built in `clamp` function, or you can write your own function. \"\"\" function noisify x Number, s your code here return missing end md\"\"\" 👉 Write the second method `noisify c AbstractRGB, s ` to add random noise of intensity s to each of the r, g, b values in a colour. Use your previous method for `noisify`. Remember that Julia chooses which method to use based on the input arguments. So to call the method from the previous exercise, the first argument should be a number. \"\"\" function noisify color AbstractRGB, s your code here return missing end md\"\"\" Noise strength \"\"\" bind color noise Slider 0 0.01 1, show value true md\"\"\" Note about array comprehension At this point, you already know of a few ways to make a new array based on one that already exists. 1. you can use a for loop to go through a array 1. you can use function broadcasting over a array 1. you can use array comprehension The third option you are about to see demonstrated below and following the following syntax ``` function to apply args for args in some iterable of your choice ``` This creates a new iterable that matches what you iterate through in the second part of the comprehension.

Note in complicated climate models the values of the parameters a and B are not specified a priori , but emerge as outputs of the simulation. The simulation begins at the preindustrial equilibrium, i.e. a temperature T 0 14 °C is in balance with the pre industrial CO₂ concentration of 280 ppm until CO₂ is abruptly doubled from 280 ppm to 560 ppm. The climate responds by warming rapidly, and after a few hundred years approaches the equilibrium climate sensitivity value, by definition. \"\"\" md\"\"\" ``B `` bind B slider Slider 2.5 .001 0 show value true, default 1.3 \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 1.1 Develop understanding for feedbacks and climate sensitivity \"\"\" md\"\"\" 👉 Change the value of B using the slider above.

This factor 2 is not entirely arbitrary without substantial effort to reduce CO₂ emissions, we are expected to at least double the CO₂ in our atmosphere by 2100. Right now, our CO₂ concentration is 415 ppm round 415 280, digits 3 times the pre industrial value of 280 ppm from 1850. The CO₂ concentrations in the future depend on human action. There are several models for future concentrations, which are formed by assuming different policy scenarios . A baseline model is RCP8.5 a \"worst case\" high emissions scenario.

Unfortunately, ``B`` is also difficult to quantify empirically the relevant processes are difficult or impossible to observe directly , so there remains uncertainty as to its exact value. A value of ``B`` close to zero means that an increase in CO₂ concentrations will have a larger impact on global warming, and that more action is needed to stay below a maximum temperature. In answering such policy related question, we need to take the uncertainty in ``B`` into account. In this exercise, we will do so using a Monte Carlo simulation we generate a sample of values for ``B``, and use these values in our analysis. \"\"\" B̅ 1.3 σ 0.4 ECS B B̅, a Model.a a log 2. .

Hang in there \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 1 Convolutions in 1D As we have seen in the lectures, we can produce cool effects using the mathematical technique of convolutions . We input one image M and get a new image M' back. Conceptually we think of M as a matrix. In practice, in Julia it will be a `Matrix` of color objects, and we may need to take that into account. Ideally, however, we should write a generic function that will work for any type of data contained in the matrix. A convolution works on a small window of an image, i.e. a region centered around a given point i, j . We will suppose that the window is a square region with odd side length 2\\ell 1 , running from \\ell, \\ldots, 0, \\ldots, \\ell . The result of the convolution over a given window, centred at the point i, j is a single number this number is the value that we will use for M' i, j . Note that neighbouring windows overlap. To get started, in Exercise 1 we'll restrict ourselves to convolutions in 1D. So a window is just a 1D region from \\ell to \\ell . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 1.1 Let's create a vector `v` of random numbers of length `n 100`. \"\"\" n 60 v rand n md\" Feel free to experiment with different values Let's use the function `colored line` to view this 1D number array as a 1D image. \" begin colored line x Vector hcat Gray.

Notice that you can run the cell `v rand n ` again to regenerate new random values.\" md\"\"\" Exercise 1.2 We need to decide how to handle the boundary conditions , i.e. what happens if we try to access a position in the vector `v` beyond `1 n`. The simplest solution is to assume that v i is 0 outside the original vector however, this may lead to strange boundary effects. A better solution is to use the closest value that is inside the vector. Effectively we are extending the vector and copying the extreme values into the extended positions. Indeed, this is one way we could implement this these extra positions are called ghost cells . 👉 Write a function `extend v, i ` that checks whether the position i is inside `1 n`. If so, return the HTML \" br \" ``i``th component of `v` otherwise, return the nearest end value. \"\"\" function extend v AbstractVector, i return missing end md\" Some test cases \" example vector 0.8, 0.2, 0.1, 0.7, 0.6, 0.4 colored line example vector md\" Extended with 0 \" colored line 0, 0, example vector..., 0, 0 md\" Extended with your `extend` function \" md\"\"\" Exercise 1.3 👉 Write or copy the `mean` function from Homework 1, which takes a vector and returns the mean. \"\"\" function mean v return missing end md\"\"\" 👉 Write a function `box blur v, l ` that blurs a vector `v` with a window of length `l` by averaging the elements within a window from \\ell to \\ell . This is called a box blur . Use your function `extend` to handle the boundaries correctly.

Show the original and the new vector by creating two cells that call `colored line`. Make the parameter \\ell interactive, and call it `l box` instead of `l` to avoid a naming conflict. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 1.5 The box blur is a simple example of a convolution , i.e. a linear function of a window around each point, given by v' i \\sum m \\, v i m \\, k m , where k is a vector called a kernel . Again, we need to take care about what happens if v i m falls off the end of the vector. 👉 Write a function `convolve v, k ` that performs this convolution. You need to think of the vector k as being centred on the position i . So m in the above formula runs between \\ell and \\ell , where 2\\ell 1 is the length of the vector k . You will either need to do the necessary manipulation of indices by hand, or use the `OffsetArrays.jl` package. \"\"\" function convolve v AbstractVector, k return missing end md\" Edit the cell above, or create a new cell with your own test cases \" md\"\"\" Exercise 1.6 👉 Define a function `box blur kernel l ` which returns a kernel i.e. a vector which, when used as the kernel in `convolve`, will reproduce a box blur of length `l`. \"\"\" function box blur kernel l return missing end bind box kernel l Slider 1 5 box blur kernel test box blur kernel box kernel l md\"\"\" Let's apply your kernel to our test vector `v` first cell , and compare the result to our previous box blur function second cell .

But, of course, we know that data comes in many other forms too, as we briefly discussed in the first lecture. In this homework we will look at another very important data source written text in natural language . The word \"natural\" here is to distinguish human natural languages from computer languages. We will both analyse actual text and try to generate random text that looks like natural language. Both the analysis and synthesis of natural language are key components of artificial intelligence and are the subject of much current research https en.wikipedia.org wiki GPT 3 . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 1 Language detection In this exercise we will create a very simple Artificial Intelligence . Natural language can be quite messy, but hidden in this mess is structure , which we will look for today. Let's start with some obvious structure in English text the set of characters that we write the language in. If we generate random text by sampling choosing random characters `Char` in Julia , it does not look like English \"\"\" rand Char, 5 sample 5 random characters String rand Char, 40 join into a string md\"\"\" `Char` in Julia is the type for a Unicode https en.wikipedia.org wiki Unicode character, which includes characters like `日` and `⛄`. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Instead, let's define an alphabet , and only use those letters to sample from. To keep things simple we will ignore punctuation, capitalization, etc., and use only the following 27 characters English letters plus \"space\" \"\"\" alphabet 'a' 'z' ' ' includes the space character md\"\"\" Let's sample random characters from our alphabet \"\"\" Text String rand alphabet, 40 md\"\"\" That already looks a lot better than our first attempt But it still does not look like English text we can do better. Frequency table English words are not well modelled by this random Latin characters model. Our first observation is that some letters are more common than others . To put this observation into practice, we would like to have the frequency table of the Latin alphabet. We could search for it online, but it is actually very simple to calculate ourselves The only thing we need is a representative sample of English text. The following samples are from Wikipedia, but feel free to type in your own sample You can also enter a sample of a different language, if that language can be expressed in the Latin alphabet. Remember that the html\" img src 'https cdn.jsdelivr.net gh ionic team ionicons 5.0.0 src svg eye outline.svg' style 'width 1em height 1em margin bottom .2em ' \" button on the left of a cell will show or hide the code. We also include a sample of Spanish, which we'll use later \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 1.1 Data cleaning Looking at the sample, we see that it is quite messy it contains punctuation, accented letters and numbers. For our analysis, we are only interested in our 27 character alphabet i.e. `'a'` through `'z'` plus `' '` . We are going to clean the data using the Julia function `filter`. \"\"\" filter isodd, 6, 7, 8, 9, 5 md\"\"\" `filter` takes two arguments a function and a collection . The function is applied to each element of the collection, and it must return either `true` or `false` for each element. Such a function is often called a predicate . If the result is `true`, then that element is included in the final collection. Did you notice something cool? Functions are also just objects in Julia, and you can use them as arguments to other functions Fons thinks this is super cool. html\" br \" We have written a function `isinalphabet`, which takes a character and returns a boolean \"\"\" function isinalphabet character character ∈ alphabet end isinalphabet 'a' , isinalphabet ' ' md\"👉 Use `filter` to extract just the characters from our alphabet out of `messy sentence 1` \" messy sentence 1 \" wow 2020 ¥500 blingbling \" cleaned sentence 1 missing md\"\"\" html\" br \" We are not interested in the capitalization of letters i.e. `'A'` vs `'a'` , so we want to map these to lower case before we apply our filter. If we don't, all upper case letters would get deleted. Julia has a `map` function to do exactly this.

The word was not endemic to Romance languages, e. g. native words for forest in the Romance languages derived from the Latin silva, which denoted \"forest\" and \"wood land \" confer the English sylva and sylvan confer the Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese selva the Romanian silvă and the Old French selve, and cognates in Romance languages, e. g. the Italian foresta, Spanish and Portuguese floresta, etc., are all ultimately derivations of the French word. \"\"\", Spanish \"\"\" Un bosque es un ecosistema donde la vegetación predominante la constituyen los árboles y matas.1​ Estas comunidades de plantas cubren grandes áreas del globo terráqueo y funcionan como hábitats para los animales, moduladores de flujos hidrológicos y conservadores del suelo, constituyendo uno de los aspectos más importantes de la biosfera de la Tierra. Aunque a menudo se han considerado como consumidores de dióxido de carbono atmosférico, los bosques maduros son prácticamente neutros en cuanto al carbono, y son solamente los alterados y los jóvenes los que actúan como dichos consumidores.2​3​ De cualquier manera, los bosques maduros juegan un importante papel en el ciclo global del carbono, como reservorios estables de carbono y su eliminación conlleva un incremento de los niveles de dióxido de carbono atmosférico. Los bosques pueden hallarse en todas las regiones capaces de mantener el crecimiento de árboles, hasta la línea de árboles, excepto donde la frecuencia de fuego natural es demasiado alta, o donde el ambiente ha sido perjudicado por procesos naturales o por actividades humanas. Los bosques a veces contienen muchas especies de árboles dentro de una pequeña área como la selva lluviosa tropical y el bosque templado caducifolio , o relativamente pocas especies en áreas grandes por ejemplo, la taiga y bosques áridos montañosos de coníferas . Los bosques son a menudo hogar de muchos animales y especies de plantas, y la biomasa por área de unidad es alta comparada a otras comunidades de vegetación. La mayor parte de esta biomasa se halla en el subsuelo en los sistemas de raíces y como detritos de plantas parcialmente descompuestos.

While this is useful to demonstrate its structure, the produced text is mostly meaningless it fails to model words, let alone sentence structure. To take our model one step further, we are going to generalize what we have done so far. Instead of looking at letter combinations , we will model word combinations . And instead of analyzing the frequencies of bigrams combinations of two letters , we are going to analyze n grams . Dataset This also means that we are going to need a larger dataset to train our model on the number of English words and their combinations is much higher than the number of letters. We will train our model on the novel Emma 1815 , by Jane Austen https en.wikipedia.org wiki Emma novel . This work is in the public domain, which means that we can download the whole book as a text file from `archive.org`. We've done the process of downloading and cleaning already, and we have split the text into word and punctuation tokens. \"\"\" emma let raw text read download \"https ia800303.us.archive.org 24 items EmmaJaneAusten 753 emma pdf djvu.txt\" , String first words \"Emma Woodhouse\" last words \"THE END\" start index findfirst first words, raw text 1 stop index findlast last words, raw text end raw text start index stop index end function splitwords text clean up whitespace cleantext replace text, r\"\\s \" \" \" split on whitespace or other word boundaries tokens split cleantext, r\" \\s|\\b \" end emma words splitwords emma forest words splitwords samples.English md\"\"\" Exercise 2.1 bigrams revisited The goal of the upcoming exercises is to generalize what we have done in Exercise 1. To keep things simple, we split up our problem into smaller problems. The solution to any computational problem. First, here is a function that takes an array, and returns the array of all neighbour pairs from the original. For example, ```julia bigrams 1, 2, 3, 42 ``` gives ```julia 1,2 , 2,3 , 3,42 ``` We used integers as \"words\" in this example, but our function works with any type of word. \"\"\" function bigrams words starting positions 1 length words 1 map starting positions do i words i i 1 end end bigrams 1, 2, 3, 42 md\"\"\" 👉 Next, it's your turn to write a more general function `ngrams` that takes an array and a number n , and returns all subsequences of length n . For example ```julia ngrams 1, 2, 3, 42 , 3 ``` should give ```julia 1,2,3 , 2,3,42 ``` and ```julia ngrams 1, 2, 3, 42 , 2 bigrams 1, 2, 3, 42 ``` \"\"\" function ngrams words, n return missing end ngrams 1, 2, 3, 42 , 3 ngrams forest words, 4 md\"\"\" If you are stuck, you can write `ngrams words, n bigrams words ` ignoring the true value of n , and continue with the other exercises. Exercise 2.2 frequency matrix revisisted In Exercise 1 we use a 2D array to store the bigram frequencies, where each column or row corresponds to a character from the alphabet. To use trigrams we could store the frequencies in a 3D array, and so on. However, when counting words instead of letters we run into a problem A 3D array with one row, column and layer per word has too many elements to store on our computer \"\"\" md\"\"\" Emma consists of length Set emma words unique words. This means that there are Int floor length Set emma words ^3 10^9 billion possible trigrams that's too many \"\"\" md\"\"\" html\" br \" Although the frequency array would be very large, most entries are zero . For example, \"Emma\" is a common word, but the sequence of words \"Emma Emma Emma\" never occurs in the novel. We about the sparsity of the non zero entries in a matrix. When a matrix is sparse in this way, we can store the same information in a more efficient structure . Julia's `SparseArrays.jl` package https docs.julialang.org en v1 stdlib SparseArrays index.html might sound like a logical choice, but the arrays from that package support only 1D and 2D types, and we also want to directly index using strings, not just integers. So instead we will use a dictionary , or `Dict` in Julia. Take a close look at the next example. Note that you can click on the output to expand the data viewer. \"\"\" healthy Dict \"fruits\" \"🍎\", \"🍊\" , \"vegetables\" \"🌽\", \"🎃\", \"🍕\" healthy \"fruits\" md\"\"\" Did you notice something funny? The dictionary is unordered , this is why the entries were printed in reverse from the definition. You can dynamically add or change values of a `Dict` by assigning to `my dict key `. You can check whether a key already exists using `haskey my dict, key `. 👉 Use these two techniques to write a function `word counts` that takes an array of words, and returns a `Dict` with entries `word number of occurences`. For example ```julia word counts \"to\", \"be\", \"or\", \"not\", \"to\", \"be\" ``` should return ```julia Dict \"to\" 2, \"be\" 2, \"or\" 1, \"not\" 1 ``` \"\"\" function word counts words Vector counts Dict your code here return counts end word counts \"to\", \"be\", \"or\", \"not\", \"to\", \"be\" md\"\"\" 👉 Write code to find how many times `\"Emma\"` occurs in the book. \"\"\" emma count missing md\"\"\" Great Let's get back to our n grams. For the purpose of generating text, we are going to store a completion cache . This is a dictionary where each key is an n 1 gram, and the corresponding value is the vector of all those words which can complete it to an n gram. Let's look at an example ```julia let trigrams ngrams split \"to be or not to be that is the question\", \" \" , 3 cache completions cache trigrams cache Dict \"to\", \"be\" \"or\", \"that\" , \"be\", \"or\" \"not\" , \"or\", \"not\" \"to\" , ... end ``` So for trigrams the keys are the first 2 words of each trigram, and the values are arrays containing every third word of those trigrams. If the same n gram occurs multiple times e.g. \"said Emma laughing\" , then the last word \"laughing\" should also be stored multiple times. This will allow us to generate trigrams with the same frequencies as the original text. 👉 Write the function `completion cache`, which takes an array of ngrams i.e. an array of arrays of words, like the result of your `ngram` function , and returns a dictionary like described above. \"\"\" function completion cache grams cache Dict your code here cache end let trigrams ngrams split \"to be or not to be that is the question\", \" \" , 3 completion cache trigrams end md\"\"\" What is this cache telling us? In our sample text, the words \"to be\" were followed by \"or\" and by \"that\". So if we are generating text, and the last two words we wrote are \"to be\", we can look at the cache, and see that the next word can be either \"or\" or \"that\". \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 2.4 write a novel We have everything we need to generate our own novel The final step is to sample random ngrams, in a way that each next ngram overlaps with the previous one. We've done this in the function `generate from ngrams` below feel free to look through the code, or to implement your own version. \"\"\" \"\"\" generate from ngrams grams, num words Given an array of ngrams i.e. an array of arrays of words , generate a sequence of `num words` words by sampling random ngrams. \"\"\" function generate from ngrams grams, num words n length first grams cache completion cache grams we need to start the sequence with at least n 1 words. a simple way to do so is to pick a random ngram sequence rand grams ... we iteratively add one more word at a time for i ∈ n 1 num words the previous n 1 words tail sequence end n 2 end possible next words completions cache tail choice rand completions push sequence, choice end sequence end \"Compute the ngrams of an array of words, but add the first n 1 at the end, to ensure that every ngram ends in the the beginning of another ngram.\" function ngrams circular words, n ngrams words..., words 1 n 1 ... , n end completion cache ngrams circular forest words, 3 \"\"\" generate source text AbstractString, num token n 3, use words true Given a source text, generate a `String` that \"looks like\" the original text by satisfying the same ngram frequency distribution as the original. \"\"\" function generate source text AbstractString, s n 3, use words true preprocess if use words splitwords else collect end words preprocess source text if length words n \"\" else grams ngrams circular words, n result generate from ngrams grams, s if use words join result, \" \" else String result end end end md\" Interactive demo Enter your own text in the box below, and use that as training data to generate anything \" bind generate demo sample TextField 50, 5 , default samples.English md\"\"\"Using bind generate sample n letters NumberField 1 5 grams for characters\"\"\" md\"\"\"Using bind generate sample n words NumberField 1 5 grams for words\"\"\" md\"\"\" Automatic Jane Austen Uncomment the cell below to generate some Jane Austen text \"\"\" generate emma, 100 n 4 | Quote md\" Function library Just some helper functions used in the notebook.\" function Quote text AbstractString text | Markdown.Paragraph | Markdown.BlockQuote | Markdown.MD end samples.English | Quote String rand alphabet, 400 | Quote if sample freqs missing String rand sample letter sample freqs for in 1 400 | Quote end String rand alphabet, 400 | Quote String rand sample letter letter frequencies ex23 sample for in 1 400 | Quote sample text transition frequencies clean ex23 sample , 400 | Quote generate generate demo sample, 400 n generate sample n letters, use words false | Quote generate generate demo sample, 100 n generate sample n words, use words true | Quote function compimg img, labels c d for c in replace alphabet, ' ' \" \" , d in replace alphabet, ' ' \" \" xmax, ymax size img xmin, ymin 0, 0 arr j 1, i 1 for i 1 ymax, j 1 xmax compose context units UnitBox xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax , fill vec img , compose context , fill \"white\" , font \"monospace\" , text first. arr . .1, last. arr . 0.6, labels , rectangle first. arr , last. arr , fill 1.0, length arr , fill 1.0, length arr end function show pair frequencies A imshow let to rgb x RGB 0.36x, 0.82x, 0.8x to rgb.

We will think through all the \"gut reaction\" solutions, and then finally end up with the dynamic programming solution that we saw in the lecture. In the process we will understand the performance and accuracy of each iteration of our solution. How to implement the solutions For every variation of the algorithm, your job is to write a function which takes a matrix of energies, and an index for a pixel on the first row, and computes a \"seam\" starting at that pixel. The function should return a vector of as many integers as there are rows in the input matrix where each number points out a pixel to delete from the corresponding row. it acts as the input to `remove in each row` . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 1.1 The greedy approach The first approach discussed in the lecture included below is the greedy approach you start from your top pixel, and at each step you just look at the three neighbors below.

The classic example, is a Fibonacci number https en.wikipedia.org wiki Fibonacci number generator. The recursive implementation of Fibonacci looks something like this \"\"\" md\"\"\" Notice that you can call a function from within itself which may call itself and so on until a base case is reached. Then the program will combine the result from the base case up to the final result. In the case of the Fibonacci function, we added the solutions to the subproblems `fib n 1 `, `fib n 2 ` to produce `fib n `. An analogy can be drawn to the process of mathematical induction in mathematics. And as with mathematical induction there are parts to constructing such a recursive algorithm Defining a base case Defining an recursion i.e. finding a solution to the problem as a combination of solutions to smaller problems. \"\"\" md\"\"\" 👉 Define a `least energy` function which returns 1. the lowest possible total energy for a seam starting at the pixel at i, j 2. the column to jump to on the next move in row i 1 , which is one of j 1 , j or j 1 , up to boundary conditions.

As stated in the video, the function `least energy` is called repeatedly with the same arguments. In fact, we call it on the order of 3^n times, when there are only really m \\times n unique ways to call it Lets implement memoization on this function with first a dictionary https docs.julialang.org en v1 base collections Dictionaries for storage. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 2.1 Dictionary as storage Let's make a memoized version of least energy function which takes a dictionary and first checks to see if the dictionary contains the key i,j if it does, returns the value stored in that place, if not, will compute it, and store it in the dictionary at key i, j and return the value it computed. `memoized least energy energies, starting pixel, memory ` This function must recursively call itself, and pass the same `memory` object it received as an argument. You are expected to read and understand the documentation on dictionaries https docs.julialang.org en v1 base collections Dictionaries to find out how to 1. Create a dictionary 2.

Hang in there \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 1 When is zero not quite zero? Students used to pure math are sometimes surprised to see numbers like `1e 15`, `1e 16`, or `1e 17` appearing in computations when `0` might have been expected. At first glance, this behaviour seems 'random' or 'noisy', but in this exercise, we will try to demonstrate some structure behind floating point artihmetic. Exercise 1.1 👉 Find all integers j with 1 ≤ j ≤ 1000 for which Julia's result satisfies `j 1 j ≠ 1`. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Notice that when you re run the computation, the result does not change. Floating point arithmetic is not random Exercise 1.2 👉 Take the smallest number `j` you found above and compute the error, i.e. the distance between `j 1 j ` and `1`. Is this an integer power of 2?

It is not the fuzz or slop that you may have seen as experimental errors in maybe a chemistry or physics class. If you are interested, we may show more later in the semester. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 2 Rank one matrices In this exercise we will go into some more detail about how to define types in Julia in order to make a structured matrix type, similar to the `OneHotVector` type from class. To begin, we will make a type to represent a rank 1 matrix. A rank 1 matrix is a matrix whose columns are all multiples of each other. This already tells us a lot about the matrix in fact, we can represent any such matrix as the outer product of two vectors `v` and `w`. Only the two vectors will be stored the matrix elements will be calculated on demand, i.e. when we index into the object. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 2.1 Let's make a `FirstRankOneMatrix` type that contains two vectors of floats, `v` and `w`. Here `v` represents a column and `w` the multipliers for each column. We include in the same cell, due to requirements of Pluto a constructor that takes a single vector `v` and duplicates it. \"\"\" md\"\"\" 👉 Create an object of type `FirstRankOneMatrix` representing the multiplication table of the numbers from 1 to 10 and the numbers from 1 to 12. Call it `ten twelve`. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 2.2 extending Base methods Right now, our `FirstRankOneMatrix` is just a container for two arrays. To make it behave like a matrix, we add methods to functions in `Base`, Julia's standard set of functions. Most of the functions you have used so far come from base, for example \"\"\" md\"\"\" These are built in functions, and each function comes with a set of methods pre defined in Julia's source code which is mostly written in Julia . Uncomment the next cell to see the full list of methods for `size`. We will add a method to this list \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's extend the `size` and `getindex` methods so that they can also work with our rank 1 matrices. This will allow us to easily access the size and entries of the matrix. \"\"\" md\"\"\" 👉 Extend `Base.size` for the type `FirstRankOneMatrix` to return the size as a tuple of values corresponding to each direction. \"\"\" md\"\"\" 👉 Extend `Base.getindex` for the type `FirstRankOneMatrix` to return the i, j th entry of the outer product. \"\"\" Base.getindex ten twelve, 5, 11 md\"\"\" Exercise 2.3 If you ask Julia to display the value of an object of type `FirstRankOneMatrix`, you will notice that it doesn't do what we are used to, which is probably to display the whole matrix that it corresponds to. Let's see \"\"\" md\"\"\" This is what matrices normally look like in Julia \"\"\" md\"\"\" One possible workaround for this is to create a new function specifically to display a matrix of our custom type. 👉 Make a function `print as matrix` that prints the entries of a matrix of type `FirstRankOneMatrix` in a grid format. We'll test that it works below with the matrix `R` we already created. \"\"\" md\"\"\" We should now be able to see our `FirstRankOneMatrix` type matrix displayed in the terminal \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 2.4 AbstractMatrix In fact, Julia together with Pluto can do some of this work for us Julia provides facilities to make our life easier when we tell Julia that our type behaves like an array. We do so by making the type a subtype of `AbstractMatrix`. This will let our type inherit the methods and attributes that come with the `AbstractMatrix` type by default including some display functions that Pluto notebooks use. Let's do all this on a new rank one matrix type `RankOneMatrix`. As we do this, we will also remove the restriction to `Float64` type entries by using a parametrised type `T`. Parametrised types allow us flexibility to handle different types of entries without repeating a lot of code we won't go too in depth about these for now. \"\"\" md\"\"\" In the cell above, we added a second 'outer' constructor that takes a single vector as argument. 👉 Make sure that you can use both constructors by trying them out below. \"\"\" md\"\"\" 👉 Add `getindex` and `size` methods for this new type. These will allow us to access entries of our custom matrices with the usual index notation `M i,j `, as well as quickly retrieving their dimensions. \"\"\" Base.getindex R2, 2, 3 md\"\"\" 👉 Create an object of the new type for the 10 \\times 10 multiplication matrix, using a single range. \"\"\" md\"\"\" You should see two things Firstly, the matrix now contains integers, instead of floats this is thanks to our parametrised type . And secondly, Julia automatically displays the matrix as we wanted, once you have defined `getindex` and `size`, provided you have told Julia that your type is a subtype of `AbstractArray` \"\"\" md\"\"\" Julia also allows us to automatically convert the matrix to a normal \"dense\" matrix, using either `collect` or `Array`. Let's try these out. You may need to re run the cell below after completing the exercises. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Fun fact we did not define a method for `Base.collect`, and yet it works This is because we told Julia that our `RankOneMatrix` is a subtype of `AbstractMatrix`, for which `Base.collect` already has a method defined in Julia's source code. This fallback method uses `Base.getindex` and `Base.size`, which we did define. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 2.5 Why do we need a special type to represent special types of structured matrices? One reason is that not only do they give a more efficient representation in space requiring less memory to store , they can also be more efficient in time, i.e. faster . For example, let's look at matrix vector multiplication . This is a fundamental part of many, many algorithms in scientific computing, and because of this, we usually want it to be as fast as possible. For a rank one matrix given by M v w^T , the matrix vector product M \\cdot x is given by w \\cdot x v . Note that w \\cdot x is a number scalar which is multiplying the vector element by element. This computation is much faster than the usual matrix vector multiplication we are taking advantage of structure \"\"\" md\"\"\" 👉 Define a function `matvec` that takes a `RankOneMatrix` `M` and a `Vector` `x` and carries out matrix vector multiplication. We will be able to compare the result with doing the matrix vector product using the corresponding dense matrix. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 3 Low rank matrices \"\"\" md\"\"\" In this exercise we will combine rank 1 matrices into low rank matrices, which are sums of rank 1 matrices. Just like in the previous exercise, we will make custom types for these matrices, and we will be able to compute the entries of a matrix on demand as we request them instead of storing all of them always . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 3.1 👉 Make a rank 2 matrix type `RankTwoMatrix` that contains two rank 1 matrices `A` and `B`. For simplicity, you can use the `FirstRankOneMatrix` type. Include in the same cell a constructor for `RankTwoMatrix` that takes two vectors and makes the rank one matrices from those vectors. Note In principle we should check when constructing the type that the input matrices have the same dimensions, but we will just assume that they do. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 3.2 👉 Construct a rank two matrix out of the rank 1 matrix representing the multiplication table of 1.0 10.0 , together with the multiplication table of 0.0 0.1 0.9 . Note that both range arguments must contain floats, so that we can add up entries. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 3.3 👉 As with last time, extend the `getindex` and `size` methods for the `RankTwoMatrix` type. Keep in mind they are already defined for `RankOneMatrix`. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 3.4 Making a custom type for rank 2 matrices is a step forward from rank 1 matrices instead of storing two vectors, we store two rank 1 matrices themselves. What if we want to represent a rank 3 matrix? We would need to store three rank 1 matrices, instead of just two. What about rank 4, rank 5, and so on? We can go even further and make a general custom type `LowRankMatrix` for rank k matrices, for general ideally low k . In this case, we should store two main things the list of rank 1 matrices that our low rank matrix is made up of, and also the rank of the matrix which is how many rank 1 matrices we are storing . 👉 Complete the definition for the type `LowRankMatrix`. Remember to store both the rank 1 matrices and the rank of the matrix itself. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 3.5 👉 Extend the `getindex` and `size` methods to work with the `LowRankMatrix` type. As before, remember that these are already defined for `RankOneMatrix`. \"\"\" function Base.size M LowRankMatrix return missing Your code here end size Base.size Base.size ten twelve Base.size R2 let comp1, comp2 RankOneMatrix 1.0 1.0 10.0 , RankOneMatrix 0.0 0.1 0.9 ex3 LowRankMatrix comp1, comp2 , 2 end md\"\"\" Exercise 3.6 👉 Extend the method `matvec` to work with our custom type `LowRankMatrix` and a `Vector` . Remember that `matvec` is already defined for `RankOneMatrix`. \"\"\" function matvec M LowRankMatrix, x return missing Your code here end md\"\"\" Exercise 3.7 One of the big advantages of our rank 1 matrices is its space efficiency to \"store\" a n\\times n matrix, we only need to actually store two vectors of n entries, as opposed of n^2 total entries. Rank 2 matrices are a litte less efficient we store two rank 1 matrices, or four vectors of n vertices. As we increase the rank, we lose space efficiency, at the cost of being able to represent more kinds of matrices. 👉 For what rank will a matrix of rank k need the same amount of storage as the dense version? Explain your answer. \"\"\" answer md\"\"\" From rank ... Because .... \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 4 The SVD for structured matrices In a math class, you may or may not learn about the singular value decomposition SVD . From a computational thinking point of view, whether you have seen this before or not we hope will not matter. Here we would like you to get to \"know\" the SVD , through experience, rather than through a math lecture. This is how we see \"computational thinking\" after all. Definitely do not look up some eigenvalue definition. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 4.1 The `LinearAlgebra` package defines a function `svd` that computes the decomposition for us. Have a look at the result of calling the `svd` function.

The error is telling us that no `svd` method has been defined for our type . Let's extend the `svd` function to work on objects of our type. \"\"\" A RankOneMatrix rand 3 ,rand 4 md\"\"\" 👉 Extend `svd` to work directly on a rank one matrix, by writing a new method.

Does that make sense? \"\"\" md\"\"\" This number the number of singular values that are positive is something you will or have learn ed in a linear algebra class it is known as the rank of a matrix, and is usually defined through a complicated elimination procedure. 👉 Write a function `numerical rank` that calculates the singular values of a matrix `A`, and returns how many of them are approximately zero. To keep things simple, you can assume that \"approximately zero\" means less than `tol 1e5`. \"\"\" function numerical rank A AbstractMatrix tol 1e 5 return missing end numerical rank A numerical rank rand 3,3 md\"\"\" Exercise 4.4 👉 Write a function that takes an argument k and generates the sum of k random rank one matrices of size mxn, and counts the number of essentially non zero singular values.

Feel free to ask questions \"\"\" md\"\"\" Initializing packages When running this notebook for the first time, this could take up to 15 minutes. Hang in there \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 1 Calculating frequencies In this exercise we practise using dictionaries in Julia by writing our own version of the `countmap` function. Recall that that function counts the number of times that a given discrete value occurs in an input data set. A suitable data structure for this is a dictionary , since it allows us to store data that is very sparse i.e. for which many input values do not occur . \"\"\" function counts data Vector counts Dict Int,Int your code here return counts end counts 7, 8, 9, 7 md\"\"\" Test that your code is correct by applying it to obtain the counts of the data vector `test data` defined below. What should the result be? Test that you do get the correct result and call the result `test counts`. \"\"\" test data 1, 0, 1, 0, 1000, 1, 1, 1000 test counts counts test data md\"\"\" Exercise 1.2 The dictionary contains the information as a sequence of pairs mapping keys to values. This is not a particularly useful form for us. Instead, we would prefer a vector of the keys and a vector of the values, sorted in order of the key. We are going to make a new version `counts2` where you do the following below . Start off by just running the following commands each in their own cell on the dictionary `test counts` you got by running the previous `counts` function on the vector `test data` so that you see the result of running each command. Once you have understood what's happening at each step, add them to the `counts2` function in a new cell. 👉 Extract vectors `ks` of keys and `vs` of values using the `keys ` and `values ` functions and convert the results into a vector using the `collect` function. \"\"\" md\"\"\" 👉 Define a variable `perm` as the result of running the function `sortperm` on the keys. This gives a permutation that tells you in which order you need to take the keys to give a sorted version. \"\"\" md\"\"\" 👉 Use indexing `ks perm ` to find the sorted keys and values vectors. Here we are passing in a vector as the index. Julia extracts the values at the indices given in that vector \"\"\" md\"\"\" Verify that your new `counts2` function gives the correct result for the vector `v` by comparing it to the true result that you get by doing the counting by hand \"\"\" md\"\"\" 👉 Create the function `counts2` that performs these steps. \"\"\" function counts2 data Vector return missing end counts2 test data md\"\"\" Exercise 1.3 👉 Make a function `probability distribution` that normalizes the result of `counts2` to calculate the relative frequencies of each value, i.e. to give a probability distribution i.e. such that the sum of the resulting vector is 1 . The function should return the keys the unique data that was in the original data set, as calculated in `counts2`, and the probabilities relative frequencies . Test that it gives the correct result for the vector `vv`. We will use this function in the rest of the exercises. \"\"\" function probability distribution data Vector return missing end probability distribution test data md\"\"\" Intermezzo function vs. begin vs. let html\" span id function begin let span \" In our lecture materials, we sometimes use a `let` block in this cell to group multiple expressions together, but how is it different from `begin` or `function`? function Writing functions is a way to group multiple expressions i.e. lines of code together into a mini program. Note the following about functions A function always returns one object . ^1 This object can be given explicitly by writing `return x`, or implicitly Julia functions always return the result of the last expression by default. So `f x x 2` is the same as `f x return x 2`. Variables defined inside a function are not accessible outside the function . We say that function bodies have a local scope . This helps to keep your program easy to read and write if you define a local variable, then you don't need to worry about it in the rest of the notebook. There are two other ways to group expressions together that you might have seen before `begin` and `let`. begin `begin` will group expressions together, and it takes the value of its last subexpression. We use it in this notebook when we want multiple expressions to always run together. let `let` also groups multiple expressions together into one, but variables defined inside of it are local they don't affect code outside of the block. So like `begin`, it is just a block of code, but like `function`, it has a local variable scope. We use it when we want to define some local temporary variables to produce a complicated result, without interfering with other cells. Pluto allows only one definition per global variable of the same name, but you can define local variables with the same names whenever you wish ^1 Even a function like `f x return` returns one object the object `nothing` — try it out \"\"\" md\"\"\" Example of a scope problem with `begin` The following will not work, because `fruits` has multiple definitions \"\"\" md\"\"\" Solved using `let` \"\"\" let vegetables \"🥦\", \"🥔\", \"🥬\" length vegetables end let vegetables \"🌽\" length vegetables end md\"\"\" This works, because `vegetables` is only defined as a local variable inside the cell , not as a global \"\"\" vegetables md\"\"\" Exercise 2 Modelling component failure with the geometric distribution In this exercise, we will investigate the simple model of failure of mechanical components or light bulbs, or radioactive decay, or recovery from an infection, or... that we saw in lectures. Let's call \\tau the time to failure. We will use a simple model, in which each component has probability p to fail each day. If it fails on day n , then \\tau n . We see that \\tau is a random variable, so we need to study its probability distribution . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 2.1 👉 Define the function `bernoulli p ` from lectures. Recall that this generates `true` with probability p and `false` with probability 1 p . \"\"\" function bernoulli p Real return missing end md\"\"\" Exercise 2.2 👉 Write a function `geometric p `. This should run a simulation with probability p to recover and wait until the individual recovers, at which point it returns the time taken to recover. The resulting failure time is known as a geometric random variable , or a random variable whose distribution is the geometric distribution . \"\"\" function geometric p Real return missing end geometric 0.25 md\"\"\" We should always be aware of special cases sometimes called \"boundary conditions\" . Make sure not to run the code with p 0 What would happen in that case? Your code should check for this and throw an `ArgumentError` as follows ```julia throw ArgumentError \"...\" ``` with a suitable error message. \"\"\" md\"\"\" 👉 What happens for p 1 ? \"\"\" interpretation of p equals one md\"\"\" blablabla \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 2.3 👉 Write a function `experiment p, N ` that runs the `geometric` function `N` times and collects the results into a vector. \"\"\" function experiment p Real, N Integer return missing end small experiment experiment 0.5, 20 md\"\"\" Exercise 2.4 Let's run an experiment with p 0.25 and N 10,000 .

Note that `vline ` requires a vector of values where you wish to draw vertical lines. \"\"\" let your code here end md\"\"\" html\" span id note about plotting span \" Note about plotting Plots.jl has an interesting property a plot is an object, not an action. Functions like `plot`, `bar`, `histogram` don't draw anything on your screen they just return a `Plots.Plot`. This is a struct that contains the description of a plot what data should be plotted in what way? , not the picture . So a Pluto cell with a single line, `plot 1 10 `, will show a plot, because the result of the function `plot` is a `Plot` object, and Pluto just shows the result of a cell. Modifying plots Nice plots are often formed by overlaying multiple plots. In Plots.jl, this is done using the modifying functions `plot `, `bar `, `vline `, etc. These take an extra first argument a previous plot to modify. For example, to plot the `sin`, `cos` and `tan` functions in the same view, we do ```julia function sin cos plot T 1.0 0.01 1.0 result plot T, sin. T plot result, T, cos. T plot result, T, tan. T return result end ``` 💡 This example demonstrates a useful pattern to combine plots 1. Create a new plot and store it in a variable 2. Modify that plot to add more elements 3. Return the plot Grouping expressions It is highly recommended that these 3 steps happen within a single cell . This can prevent some strange glitches when re running cells. There are three ways to group expressions together into a single cell `begin`, `let` and `function`. More on this here function begin let \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 2.5 👉 What shape does the distribution seem to have? Can you verify that by using one or more log scales in a new plot? \"\"\" md\"\"\" Use the widgets from PlutoUI to write an interactive visualization that performs Exercise 2.3 for p varying between 0 and 1 and N between 0 and 100,000 . You might want to go back to Exercise 2.3 to turn your code into a function that can be called again. As you vary p , what do you observe? Does that make sense? \"\"\" bind hello Slider 2 0.5 10 hello md\"\"\" Exercise 2.6 👉 For fixed N 10,000 , write a function that calculates the mean time to recover, \\langle \\tau p \\rangle , as a function of p . \"\"\" md\"\"\" 👉 Use plots of your function to find the relationship between \\langle \\tau p \\rangle and p . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Based on my observations, it looks like we have the following relationship ```math \\langle \\tau p \\rangle my \\cdot answer \\cdot here ``` \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 3 More efficient geometric distributions Let's use the notation P n \\mathbb P \\tau n for the probability to fail on the n th step. Probability theory tells us that in the limit of an infinite number of trials, we have the following exact results P 1 p P 2 p 1 p , and in general P n p 1 p ^ n 1 . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 3.1 👉 Fix p 0.25 . Make a vector of the values P n for n 1, \\dots, 50 . You must of course use a loop or similar construction do not do this by hand \"\"\" Ps let your code here end md\"\"\" 👉 Do they sum to 1? \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 3.2 👉 Check analytically that the probabilities sum to 1 when you include all infinitely many of them. \"\"\" md\"\"\" ```math \\sum k 1 ^ \\infty P k \\dots your \\cdot answer \\cdot here \\dots 1 ``` \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 3.3 Sum of a geometric series \"\"\" md\"\"\" 👉 Plot P n as a function of n . Compare it to the corresponding result from the previous exercise i.e. plot them both on the same graph . \"\"\" md\"\"\" 👉 How could we measure the error , i.e. the distance between the two graphs? What do you think determines it? \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 3.4 If p is small , say p 0.001 , then the algorithm we used in Exercise 2 to sample from geometric distribution will be very slow, since it just sits there calculating a lot of `false`s The average amount of time taken is what you found in 1.8 . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's make a better algorithm. Think of each probability P n as a \"bin\", or interval, of length P n . If we lay those bins next to each other starting from P 1 on the left, then P 2 , etc., there will be an infinite number of bins that fill up the interval between 0 and 1 . In principle there is no upper limit on how many days it will take to recover, although the probability becomes very small. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Now suppose we take a uniform random number r between 0 and 1 . That will fall into one of the bins. If it falls into the bin corresponding to P n , then we return n as the recovery time \"\"\" md\"\"\" 👉 To draw this picture, we need to add up the lengths of the lines from 1 to n for each n , i.e. calculate the cumulative sum . Write a function `cumulative sum`, which returns a new vector. \"\"\" function cumulative sum xs Vector return missing end cumulative sum 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 md\"\"\" 👉 Plot the resulting values on a horizontal line. Generate a few random points and plot those.

We will see more about random walks in lectures. We can think of a very light dust particle being moved around by the wind. We are only interested in its vertical position, y , and we will suppose for simplicity that y is an integer. The particle jumps up and down randomly as it is moved by the wind however, due to gravity it has a higher probability p of moving downwards to y 1 than upwards to y 1 , which happens with probability 1 p . At y 1 there is a boundary condition it hits a reflective boundary the \"surface of the Earth\" . We can model this using \"bounce back\" if the particle tries to jump downwards from y 1 then it hits a reflective boundary and bounces back to y 1 . In other words it remains in the same place. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 4.1 👉 Write a simulation of this model in a function `atmosphere` that accepts `p`, the initial height `y0`, and the number of steps N as variables. \"\"\" function atmosphere p Real, y0 Real, N Integer return missing end atmosphere 0.8, 10, 50 md\"\"\" Let's simulate it for 10^7 time steps with x 0 10 and p 0.55 .

Hang in there \"\"\" function bernoulli p Number rand p end md\"\"\" Exercise 1 Agent based model for an epidemic outbreak types In this and the following exercises we will develop a simple stochastic model for combined infection and recovery in a population, which may exhibit an epidemic outbreak i.e. a large spike in the number of infectious people . The population is well mixed , i.e. everyone is in contact with everyone else. An example of this would be a small school or university in which people are constantly moving around and interacting with each other. The model is an individual based or agent based model we explicitly keep track of each individual, or agent , in the population and their infection status. For the moment we will not keep track of their position in space we will just assume that there is some mechanism, not included in the model, by which they interact with other individuals. Exercise 1.1 Each agent will have its own internal state , modelling its infection status, namely \"susceptible\", \"infectious\" or \"recovered\". We would like to code these as values `S`, `I` and `R`, respectively. One way to do this is using an enumerated type https en.wikipedia.org wiki Enumerated type or enum . Variables of this type can take only a pre defined set of values the Julia syntax is as follows \"\"\" enum InfectionStatus S I R md\"\"\" We have just defined a new type `InfectionStatus`, as well as names `S`, `I` and `R` that are the only possible values that a variable of this type can take. 👉 Define a variable `test status` whose value is `S`. \"\"\" test status missing md\"\"\" 👉 Use the `typeof` function to find the type of `test status`. \"\"\" md\"\"\" 👉 Convert `x` to an integer using the `Integer` function. What value does it have? What values do `I` and `R` have? \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 1.2 For each agent we want to keep track of its infection status and the number of other agents that it infects during the simulation. A good solution for this is to define a new type `Agent` to hold all of the information for one agent, as follows \"\"\" mutable struct Agent status InfectionStatus num infected Int64 end md\"\"\" When you define a new type like this, Julia automatically defines one or more constructors , which are methods of a generic function with the same name as the type. These are used to create objects of that type. 👉 Use the `methods` function to check how many constructors are pre defined for the `Agent` type. \"\"\" md\"\"\" 👉 Create an agent `test agent` with status `S` and `num infected` equal to 0. \"\"\" test agent missing md\"\"\" 👉 For convenience, define a new constructor i.e. a new method for the function that takes no arguments and creates an `Agent` with status `S` and number infected 0, by calling one of the default constructors that Julia creates. This new method lives outside not inside the definition of the `struct`. It is called an outer constructor . In Pluto, a struct definition and an outer constructor need to be combined in a single cell using a `begin end` block. Let's check that the new method works correctly. How many methods does the constructor have now? \"\"\" Agent md\"\"\" Exercise 1.3 👉 Write functions `set status a ` and `set num infected a ` which modify the respective fields of an `Agent`. Check that they work. Note the bang \"` `\" at the end of the function names to signify that these functions modify their argument. \"\"\" function set status agent Agent, new status InfectionStatus your code here end md\"\"\" 👉 We will also need functions `is susceptible` and `is infected` that check if a given agent is in those respective states. \"\"\" function is susceptible agent Agent return missing end function is infected agent Agent return missing end md\"\"\" Exercise 1.4 👉 Write a function `generate agents N ` that returns a vector of `N` freshly created `Agent`s. They should all be initially susceptible, except one, chosen at random i.e. uniformly , who is infectious. \"\"\" function generate agents N Integer return missing end generate agents 3 md\"\"\" We will also need types representing different infections. Let's define an immutable `struct` called `InfectionRecovery` with parameters `p infection` and `p recovery`. We will make it a subtype of an abstract `AbstractInfection` type, because we will define more infection types later. \"\"\" abstract type AbstractInfection end struct InfectionRecovery AbstractInfection p infection p recovery end md\"\"\" Exercise 1.5 👉 Write a function `interact ` that takes an affected `agent` of type `Agent`, an `source` of type `Agent` and an `infection` of type `InfectionRecovery`. It implements a single one sided interaction between two agents If the `agent` is susceptible and the `source` is infectious, then the `source` infects our `agent` with the given infection probability. If the `source` successfully infects the other agent, then its `num infected` record must be updated. If the `agent` is infected then it recovers with the relevant probability. Otherwise, nothing happens. html\" span id interactfunction span \" \"\"\" function interact agent Agent, source Agent, infection InfectionRecovery your code here end md\"\"\" Play around with the test case below to test your function Try changing the definitions of `agent`, `source` and `infection`. Since we are working with randomness, you might want to run the cell multiple times. \"\"\" let agent Agent S, 0 source Agent I, 0 infection InfectionRecovery 0.9, 0.5 interact agent, source, infection agent agent, source source end md\"\"\" Exercise 2 Agent based model for an epidemic outbreak Monte Carlo simulation In this exercise we will build on Exercise 2 to write a Monte Carlo simulation of how an infection propagates in a population. Make sure to re use the functions that we have already written, and introduce new ones if they are helpful Short functions make it easier to understand what the function does and build up new functionality piece by piece. You should not use any global variables inside the functions Each function must accept as arguments all the information it requires to carry out its task. You need to think carefully about what the information each function requires. Exercise 2.1 👉 Write a function `step ` that takes a vector of `Agent`s and an `infection` of type `InfectionRecovery`. It implements a single step of the infection dynamics as follows Choose two random agents an `agent` and a `source`. Apply `interact agent, source, infection `. Return `agents`. \"\"\" function step agents Vector Agent , infection InfectionRecovery end md\"\"\" 👉 Write a function `sweep `. It runs `step ` N times, where N is the number of agents. Thus each agent acts, on average, once per sweep a sweep is thus the unit of time in our Monte Carlo simulation. \"\"\" function sweep agents Vector Agent , infection AbstractInfection end md\"\"\" 👉 Write a function `simulation` that does the following 1. Generate the N agents. 2. Run `sweep ` a number T of times. Calculate and store the total number of agents with each status at each step in variables `S counts`, `I counts` and `R counts`. 3. Return the vectors `S counts`, `I counts` and `R counts` in a named tuple , with keys `S`, `I` and `R`. You've seen an example of named tuples before the `student` variable at the top of the notebook Feel free to store the counts in a different way, as long as the return type is the same. \"\"\" function simulation N Integer, T Integer, infection AbstractInfection return S missing, I missing, R missing end simulation 3, 20, InfectionRecovery 0.9, 0.2 simulation 100, 1000, InfectionRecovery 0.005, 0.2 bind run basic sir Button \"Run simulation again \" let run basic sir N 100 T 1000 sim simulation N, T, InfectionRecovery 0.02, 0.002 result plot 1 T, sim.S, ylim 0, N , label \"Susceptible\" plot result, 1 T, sim.I, ylim 0, N , label \"Infectious\" plot result, 1 T, sim.R, ylim 0, N , label \"Recovered\" end md\"\"\" Exercise 2.2 Alright Every time that we run the simulation, we get slightly different results, because it is based on randomness. By running the simulation a number of times, you start to get an idea of the mean behaviour of our model.

In the next cells, we run your simulation `num simulations 20` times with N 100 , p \\text infection 0.02 , p \\text infection 0.002 and T 1000 .

This new type `Reinfection` should also be a subtype of `AbstractInfection`.

Hang in there \"\"\" md\"\"\" In the past couple homeworks, we've messed around with probability distributions and Monte Carlo simulations. This time, we'll build a more mathematical model, and we'll use optimization to fit it to given data. Models have parameters , such as the rate of recovery from infection. Where do the parameter values come from? Ideally we would like to extract them from data. The goal of this homework is to do this by fitting a model to data. For simplicity, we will use data that generated from a spatial model one that simulates the movement of a population in space instead of real world data, and we will fit the simplest SIR model. But the same ideas apply more generally. There are many ways to fit a function to data, but all must involve some form of optimization , usually minimization of a particular function, a loss function this is the basis of the vast field of machine learning . The loss function is a function of the model parameters it measures how far the model output is from the data, for the given values of the parameters. We emphasise that this material is pedagogical there is no suggestion that these specific techniques should be used actual calculations rather, it is the underlying ideas that are important. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 1 Calculus without calculus \"\"\" md\"\"\" Before we jump in to simulating the SIR equations, let's experiment with a simple 1D function. In calculus, we learn techniques for differentiating and integrating symbolic equations, e.g. ``\\frac d dx x^n nx^ n 1 ``. But in real applications, it is often impossible to apply these techniques, either because the problem is too complicated to solve symbolically, or because our problem has no symbolic expression, like when working with experimental results. Instead, as you will recall from lecture, we use ✨ computers ✨ to approximate derivatives and integrals. Instead of applying rules to symbolic expressions, we use much simpler strategies that only use the output values of our function . One such example is the finite difference method for approximating the derivative of a function. It is inspired by the analytical definition of the derivative f' a \\lim h \\rightarrow 0 \\frac f a h f a h . The finite difference method simply fixes a small value for h , say h 10^ 3 , and then approximates the derivative as f' a \\simeq \\frac f a h f a h . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 1.1 tangent line 👉 Write a function `finite difference slope` that takes a function `f` and numbers `a` and `h`.

Some methods also use the second derivative, other methods use multiple steps at once, etc. This is the study of Numerical Methods. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 2 Simulating the SIR differential equations We will look at a type of mathematical model for epidemic outbreaks called the SIR model . In this model, we consider three functions of time t the fraction of the population s t that is susceptible to the disease, the fraction i t that is infected , and the fraction r t that has recovered . We've already used these three quantities in a simulation before, namely in the Monte Carlo simulation from last homework It turns out that, given some assumptions about how people from the three groups interact over time, we can model the behavior of the three quantities in terms of their derivatives with respect to time t . We use two parameters \\beta and \\gamma , and with them, we can form a system of ordinary differential equations ODEs for the SIR model. They are as follows \\begin align \\dot s & \\beta s \\, i \\\\ \\dot i & \\beta s \\, i \\gamma i \\\\ \\dot r & \\gamma i \\end align where ``\\dot s \\frac ds dt `` is the derivative of s with respect to time. Recall that s denotes the proportion fraction of the population that is susceptible, a number between 0 and 1 . We will use the simplest possible method to simulate these, namely the Euler method . The Euler method is not always a good method to solve ODEs accurately, but for our purposes it is good enough. In the previous exercise, we introduced the Euler method for a 1D function, which you can see as an ODE that only depends on time. For the SIR equations, we have an ODE that only depends on the previous value , not on time, and we have 3 equations instead of 1. The solution is quite simple, we apply the Euler method to each of the differential equations within a single time step to get new values for each of s , i and r at the end of the time step in terms of the values at the start of the time step. The Euler discretised equations are \\begin align s t h & s t h\\,\\cdot\\beta s t \\, i t \\\\ i t h & i t h\\,\\cdot \\beta s t \\, i t \\gamma i t \\\\ r t h & r t h\\,\\cdot \\gamma i t \\end align 👉 Implement a function `euler SIR step β, γ, sir 0, h ` that performs a single Euler step for these equations with the given parameter values and initial values, with a step size h . `sir 0` is a 3 element vector, and you should return a new 3 element vector with the values after the timestep. \"\"\" function euler SIR step β, γ, sir 0 Vector, h Number s, i, r sir 0 return missing, missing, missing, end euler SIR step 0.1, 0.05, 0.99, 0.01, 0.00 , 0.1 md\"\"\" 👉 Implement a function `euler SIR β, γ, sir 0, T ` that applies the previously defined function over a time range T .

Recall that \\frac \\partial f \\partial x is the derivative of the single variable function g x f x, b obtained by fixing the value of y to b . You should use anonymous functions for this.

As a refresher, we'll want to think of a function as a hill. To find a minimum we should \"roll down the hill\". Exercise 4.1 We want to minimize a 1D function, i.e. a function f \\mathbb R \\to \\mathbb R . To do so we notice that the derivative tells us the direction in which the function increases . Positive slope means that the minimum is to the left, negative slope means to the right. So our gradient descent method is to take steps in the opposite direction, of a small size \\eta \\cdot f' x 0 . 👉 Write a function `gradient descent 1d step f, x0 ` that performs a single gradient descent step, from the point `x0` and using your function `finite difference slope` to approximate the derivative.

Here \\alpha and \\beta are parameters that appear in the form of the function f . We want to find the parameters that provide the best fit , i.e. the version f \\alpha, \\beta of the function that is closest to the data when we vary \\alpha and \\beta . To do so we need to define what \"best\" means. We will define a measure of the distance between the function and the data, given by a loss function , which itself depends on the values of \\alpha and \\beta . Then we will minimize the loss function over \\alpha and \\beta to find those values that minimize this distance, and hence are \"best\" in this precise sense. The iterative procedure by which we gradually adjust the parameter values to improve the loss function is often called machine learning or just learning , since the computer is \"discovering\" information in a gradual way, which is supposed to remind us of how humans learn. Hint This is not how humans learn. Exercise 5.1 🎲 frequencies We generate a small dataset by throwing 10 dice, and counting the sum.

If we are able to find a good fit, that would suggest that the spatial aspect \"does not matter\" too much for the dynamics of these models. If the fit is not so good, perhaps there is an important effect of space. As usual in statistics, and indeed in modelling in general, we should be very cautious of making claims of this nature. This fitting procedure will be different from that in Exercise 4, however we no longer have an explicit form for the function that we are fitting. Rather, it is simply the output of an ODE So what should we do? We will try to find the parameters \\beta and \\gamma for which the output of the ODEs when we simulate it with those parameters best matches the data Exercise 6.1 Below is the result from the spatial model.

Simply edit the code, run it, and the check runs again. Feel free to ask questions \"\"\" md\" Let's create a package environment \" md\"\"\" In this problem set, we will look at a simple spatial agent based epidemic model agents can interact only with other agents that are nearby . In Homework 7, any agent could interact with any other, which is not realistic. A simple approach is to use discrete space each agent lives in one cell of a square grid. For simplicity we will allow no more than one agent in each cell, but this requires some care to design the rules of the model to respect this. We will adapt some functionality from Homework 7. You should copy and paste your code from that homework into this notebook. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 1 Wandering at random in 2D In this exercise we will implement a random walk on a 2D lattice grid .

The only special property you can use the infix notation you can write ```julia 1 2 ``` instead of ```julia 1, 2 ``` There are lots of special 'infixable' function names https github.com JuliaLang julia blob master src julia parser.scm L23 L24 that you can use for your own functions When you call it with the prefix notation, it becomes clear that it really is 'just another function', with lots of predefined methods. \"\"\" 1, 2 md\"\"\" Extending in the wild Because it is a function, we can add our own methods to it This feature is super useful in general languages like Julia and Python, because it lets you use familiar syntax `a b c` on objects that are not necessarily numbers One example we've see before is the `RGB` type in the first lectures. You are able to do ```julia 0.5 RGB 0.1, 0.7, 0.6 ``` to multiply each color channel by 0.5 . This is possible because `Images.jl` wrote a method https github.com JuliaGraphics ColorVectorSpace.jl blob 06d70b8a28f5c263f52e414745c2066ccb72b518 src ColorVectorSpace.jl L207 ```julia Real, AbstractRGB AbstractRGB ``` 👉 Implement addition on two `Coordinate` structs by adding a method to `Base. ` \"\"\" function Base. a TYPE, b TYPE return missing end Coordinate 3,4 Coordinate 10,10 uncomment to check works md\"\"\" Pluto has some trouble here, you need to manually re run the cell above \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 1.3 In our model, agents will be able to walk in 4 directions up, down, left and right.

Great 👉 Write a function `trajectory` that calculates a trajectory of a `Wanderer` `w` when performing `n` steps., i.e. the sequence of positions that the walker finds itself in. Possible steps Use `rand possible moves, n ` to generate a vector of `n` random moves. Each possible move will be equally likely. To compute the trajectory you can use either of the following two approaches 1. 🆒 Use the function `accumulate` see the live docs for `accumulate` . Use ` ` as the function passed to `accumulate` and the `w` as the starting value `init` keyword argument . 1.

We need to decide i.e. model what happens when they reach the walls of the box boundaries , in other words what kind of boundary conditions to use. One relatively simple boundary condition is a collision boundary Each wall of the box is a wall, modelled using \"collision\" if the walker tries to jump beyond the wall, it ends up at the position inside the box that is closest to the goal. 👉 Write a function `collide boundary` which takes a `Coordinate` `c` and a size L , and returns a new coordinate that lies inside the box i.e. `` L,L \\times L,L `` , but is closest to `c`. This is similar to `extend mat` from Homework 1. \"\"\" function collide boundary c Coordinate, L Number return missing end collide boundary Coordinate 12,4 , 10 uncomment to test md\"\"\" Exercise 1.6 👉 Implement a 3 argument method of `trajectory` where the third argument is a size.

Let's define a type `Agent`. `Agent` contains a `position` of type `Coordinate` , as well as a `status` of type `InfectionStatus` as in Homework 4 . For simplicity we will not use a `num infected` field, but feel free to do so \"\"\" enum InfectionStatus S I R define agent struct here md\"\"\" Exercise 2.1 👉 Write a function `initialize` that takes parameters N and L , where N is the number of agents and 2L is the side length of the square box where the agents live.

This week, we define a new infection type, `CollisionInfectionRecovery`, and a new method that is the same as last week, except it only infects `agent` if `agents.position source.position` . \"\"\" abstract type AbstractInfection end struct CollisionInfectionRecovery AbstractInfection p infection Float64 p recovery Float64 end md\"\"\" Write a function `interact ` that takes two `Agent`s and a `CollisionInfectionRecovery`, and If the agents are at the same spot, causes a susceptible agent to communicate the disease from an infectious one with the correct probability. if the first agent is infectious, it recovers with some probability \"\"\" function interact agent Agent, source Agent, infection CollisionInfectionRecovery missing end md\"\"\" Exercise 3.1 Your turn 👉 Write a function `step ` that takes a vector of `Agent`s, a box size `L` and an `infection`. This that does one step of the dynamics on a vector of agents. Choose an Agent `source` at random. Move the `source` one step, and use `collide boundary` to ensure that our agent stays within the box. For all other agents, call `interact other agent, source, infection `. return the array `agents` again. \"\"\" function step agents Vector, L Number, infection AbstractInfection return missing end md\"\"\" Exercise 3.2 If we call `step ` `N` times, then every agent will have made one step, on average. Let's call this one sweep of the simulation. 👉 Create a before and after plot of ``k sweeps 1000`` sweeps. Initialize a new vector of agents `N 50`, `L 40`, `infection` is given as `pandemic` below . Plot the state using `visualize`, and save the plot as a variable `plot before`. Run `k sweeps` sweeps. Plot the state again, and store as `plot after`. Combine the two plots into a single figure using ```julia plot plot before, plot after ``` \"\"\" pandemic CollisionInfectionRecovery 0.5, 0.00001 bind k sweeps Slider 1 10000, default 1000 let N 50 L 40 plot before plot 1 3 replace with your code plot after plot 1 3 plot plot before, plot after end md\"\"\" Exercise 3.3 Every time that you move the slider, a completely new simulation is created an run. This makes it hard to view the progress of a single simulation over time. So in this exercise, we we look at a single simulation, and plot the S, I and R curves. 👉 Plot the SIR curves of a single simulation, with the same parameters as in the previous exercise. Use `k sweep max 10000` as the total number of sweeps. \"\"\" k sweep max 10000 let N 50 L 30 agents initialize N, L compute k sweep max number of sweeps and plot the SIR end md\"\"\" Exercise 3.4 optional Let's make our plot come alive There are two options to make our visualization dynamic 👉1️⃣ Precompute one simulation run and save its intermediate states using `deepcopy`. You can then write an interactive visualization that shows both the state at time t using `visualize` and the history of S , I and R from time 0 up to time t . t is controlled by a slider. 👉2️⃣ Use ` gif` from Plots.jl to turn a sequence of plots into an animation. Be careful to skip about 50 sweeps between each animation frame, otherwise the GIF becomes too large. This an optional exercise, and our solution to 2️⃣ is given below. \"\"\" let N 50 L 30 missing end md\"\"\" Exercise 3.5 👉 Using L 20 and N 100 , experiment with the infection and recovery probabilities until you find an epidemic outbreak. Take the recovery probability quite small. Modify the two infections below to match your observations. \"\"\" causes outbreak CollisionInfectionRecovery 0.5, 0.001 does not cause outbreak CollisionInfectionRecovery 0.5, 0.001 md\"\"\" Exercise 3.6 👉 With the parameters of Exercise 3.2, run 50 simulations. Plot S , I and R as a function of time for each of them with transparency . This should look qualitatively similar to what you saw in the previous homework. You probably need different `p infection` and `p recovery` values from last week. Why? \"\"\" need different parameters because md\"\"\" i say so \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 4 Optional Effect of socialization In this exercise we'll modify the simple mixing model. Instead of a constant mixing probability, i.e. a constant probability that any pair of people interact on a given day, we will have a variable probability associated with each agent, modelling the fact that some people are more or less social or contagious than others. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 4.1 We create a new agent type `SocialAgent` with fields `position`, `status`, `num infected`, and `social score`. The attribute `social score` represents an agent's probability of interacting with any other agent in the population. \"\"\" struct SocialAgent here... md\"\"\"define the `position` and `color` methods for `SocialAgent` as we did for `Agent`.

Go back in the notebook and make the agent types a subtype of AbstractAgent. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 4.2 Not all two agents who end up in the same grid point may actually interact in an infectious way they may just be passing by and do not create enough exposure for communicating the disease. 👉 Write a new `interact ` method on `SocialAgent` which adds together the social scores for two agents and uses that as the probability that they interact in a risky way. Only if they interact in a risky way, the infection is transmitted with the usual probability. \"\"\" function interact agent SocialAgent, source SocialAgent, infection CollisionInfectionRecovery your code here end md\"\"\" Make sure `step `, `position`, `color`, work on the type `SocialAgent`. If `step ` takes an untyped first argument, it should work for both Agent and SocialAgent types without any changes. We actually only need to specialize `interact ` on SocialAgent. Exercise 4.3 👉 Plot the SIR curves of the resulting simulation. N 50 L 40 number of steps 200 In each step call `step ` 50N times. \"\"\" let N 50 L 40 global social agents initialize social N, L Ss, Is, Rs , , Tmax 200 gif for t in 1 Tmax 1. Step a lot 2.

Run this simulation several times and comment on the results. \"\"\" md\"\"\" 👉 Run a simulation for 100 steps, and then apply a \"lockdown\" where every agent's social score gets multiplied by 0.25, and then run a second simulation which runs on that same population from there. What do you notice? How does changing this factor form 0.25 to other numbers affect things? \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 5 Optional Effect of distancing We can use a variant of the above model to investigate the effect of the mis named \"social distancing\" we want people to be socially close, but physically distant . In this variant, we separate out the two effects \"infection\" and \"movement\" an infected agent chooses a neighbouring site, and if it finds a susceptible there then it infects it with probability p I . For simplicity we can ignore recovery. Separately, an agent chooses a neighbouring site to move to, and moves there with probability p M if the site is vacant. Otherwise it stays where it is. When p M 0 , the agents cannot move, and hence are completely quarantined in their original locations. 👉 How does the disease spread in this case? \"\"\" md\"\"\" 👉 Run the dynamics repeatedly, and plot the sites which become infected. \"\"\" md\"\"\" 👉 How does this change as you increase the density \\rho N L^2 of agents? Start with a small density. This is basically the site percolation https en.wikipedia.org wiki Percolation theory model. When we increase p M , we allow some local motion via random walks. \"\"\" md\"\"\" 👉 Investigate how this leaky quarantine affects the infection dynamics with different densities. \"\"\" if student.name \"Jazzy Doe\" md\"\"\" danger \"Before you submit\" Remember to fill in your name and Kerberos ID at the top of this notebook. \"\"\" end md\" Function library Just some helper functions used in the notebook.\" hint text Markdown.MD Markdown.Admonition \"hint\", \"Hint\", text hint md\"\"\" After every sweep, count the values S , I and R and push them to 3 arrays. \"\"\" hint md\"\"\" ```julia let N 50 L 40 x initialize N, L initialize to empty arrays Ss, Is, Rs Int , Int , Int Tmax 200 gif for t in 1 Tmax for i in 1 50N step x, L, pandemic end ... track S, I, R in Ss Is and Rs left visualize x, L right plot xlim 1,Tmax , ylim 1,N , size 600,300 plot right, 1 t, Ss, color color S , label \"S\" plot right, 1 t, Is, color color I , label \"I\" plot right, 1 t, Rs, color color R , label \"R\" plot left, right end end ``` \"\"\" almost text Markdown.MD Markdown.Admonition \"warning\", \"Almost there \", text still missing text md\"Replace `missing` with your answer.\" Markdown.MD Markdown.Admonition \"warning\", \"Here we go \", text keep working text md\"The answer is not quite right.\" Markdown.MD Markdown.Admonition \"danger\", \"Keep working on it \", text yays md\"Fantastic \", md\"Splendid \", md\"Great \", md\"Yay ❤\", md\"Great 🎉\", md\"Well done \", md\"Keep it up \", md\"Good job \", md\"Awesome \", md\"You got the right answer \", md\"Let's move on to the next section.\" correct text rand yays Markdown.MD Markdown.Admonition \"correct\", \"Got it \", text let we need to call Base. instead of to make Pluto understand what's going on oops if isdefined Coordinate result Base.

Hang in there \"\"\" md\" Introduction The goal of this section is to introduce you to the notion of abstraction. You can think of abstraction as an opposite to specialization. We will illustrate this by looking at the following example. What is one ? Before we get lost talking about the foundations of number theory, I will present you with a few examples that represent one to me. \" md\"Each of the items in this list is a specific, or specialized representation of one 1. as an integer 1. as a float 1. as a string 1. as a rational number 1. as a cute picture 1. as an 2x2 identity matrix 1. as a singular dog Of course, these are just a few examples of one . People have been representing one for ages in different languages, scripts, artistic expression, etc. The difference between these ones to me is clear. In fact, I just articulated it to you. Now, let's turn to how a computer sees one differently based on what I type. \" md\"So to a computer, all of these are different types.\" md\" What is a collection of one s? Now, I want to make a collection of ones for some reason. Below is a way for you to experiment building this collection with different one s. As you do this experiment, I want you to look at what stays in the same in the Julia output, and what doesn't.\" md\"\"\" Before we even look at the output, I am amazed that this code even ran. Are you telling me that the computer doesn't care which one I am using in my array? Yes That's exactly what abstraction is. By stepping back, we can now think and operate at a level that doesn't care about which specific one I am using. This is what we mean by abstraction is the opposite of specialization . The information that Julia gives back is quite informative. Here is an example of the first line of the output for a few different types ``` array 3x4 Array Int64, 2 array 3x4 Array Float64, 2 array 3x4 Array Rational Int64 , 2 ``` Notice that for all of these, we have the same `3x4 Array , 2 `. \"\"\" md\"\"\" First Taste of Abstraction Now, I want to do something to a collection of ones, that doesn't care about which one I'm using. So I'm going to write a function that takes in my collection, and add a corgi whereever I desire. \"\"\" function insert new, A, i, j B copy A B i,j new return B end begin A fill 0, 3, 4 md\"\"\" bind i Slider 1 size A,1 , show value true bind j Slider 1 size A,2 , show value true \"\"\" end begin one number array fill 1,3,4 insert 5, one number array, i, j end md\"This is still amazing. I wrote one function that just cares about how to insert an object into an array, without knowing anything about what's inside, and it worked for two completely different arrays, collections of ones of any kind .\" md\" Conclusion The key idea here is that a computer language should allow you to do operations that make sense. Often times, an operation can make sense for many different objects. So we can abstract away the specifics of the object in our implementation. It should let you step back from there. \" md\"\"\" Appendix \"\"\" begin oneimage load download \"https user images.githubusercontent.com 6933510 199281680 5ac1e8ea c68c 4fb5 a3bf b47ad28057d1.png\" corgi load download \"https user images.githubusercontent.com 6933510 107239146 dcc3fd00 6a28 11eb 8c7b 41aaf6618935.png\" nothing end one 1, 1.0, \"one\", 1 1, oneimage, 1 0 0 1 , corgi, computer ones typeof. one begin one keys \"1\", \"1.0\", \"one\", \"1 1\", \"Cute One\", \"2x2 Identity\", \"One Corgi\" selections one keys . one keys lookup element Dict one keys . one md\" bind element key Select selections \" end your chosen one element lookup element element key its type typeof element a 3x4 array of this one. array fill element,3,4 begin one image array fill oneimage,3,4 insert corgi, one image array, i, j end "},{"url":"images_abstractions/dynamicprograms/","title":"Dynamic Programming","tags":["lecture","module1","optimization","programming","track_julia","track_math","interactive","discrete","lazy"],"text":" A Pluto.jl notebook v0.19.45 frontmatter chapter 1 video \"https www.youtube.com watch?v KyBXJV1zFlo\" image \"https user images.githubusercontent.com 6933510 136196599 c6ae60f0 9269 4134 bb0d 5bcab928bd2b.gif\" section 7 order 7 title \"Dynamic Programming\" layout \"layout.jlhtml\" youtube id \"KyBXJV1zFlo\" description \"\" tags \"lecture\", \"module1\", \"optimization\", \"programming\", \"track julia\", \"track math\", \"interactive\", \"discrete\", \"lazy\" using Markdown using InteractiveUtils This Pluto notebook uses bind for interactivity.

The word \"programming\" here is a rather archaic word but still in use for an optimization problem , as used, for example, in the phrase \"linear programming.\" Probably the word \"programming\" should be abandoned in this context, but no doubt it is too late. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Summing over paths problem \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's start by looking at the following problem. Given a matrix, we follow a path from top to bottom. The paths start at one of the square on the top, and can only go downwards, either South East , South , or South West . We will add up the numbers visited along each path. Our goal is to find the path that has the smallest sum . This is indeed an optimization problem in the set of all possible paths, we want to find a path that minimizes the sum of visited squares. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Try it yourself \"\"\" md\"\"\" Board size \"\"\" const n 8 M rand 0 9, n, n md\"\"\" One way to solve this problem is the naive algorithm where we enumerate all the paths, calculate the sum for each, and take the minimum. However, as the matrix gets larger the total number of paths grows exponentially . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Possible research problem Investigate the statistics of the sums over all possible paths. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Fixing a single point on a path \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's fix a given point i, j and focus only on all those paths that pass through i, j . \"\"\" md\"\"\" i bind fixi Scrubbable 1 n j bind fixj Scrubbable 1 n \"\"\" md\"\"\" Suppose we fix the point on the penultimate row last but one . When we look at the paths below the fixed value, we're doing the same calculation over and over again. It doesn't seem sensible to keep re doing these calculations. The same holds as we move the fixed point further upwards. So instead of calculating by working \"forwards\", for each box we look at the minimum below it. \"\"\" md\"\"\" The idea of overlapping subproblems \"\"\" md\"\"\" The key point in this problem is that there are overlapping subproblems there are calculations that we don't need to repeat.

We would be pleased if students who have been interested in computer science now become interested in computational science and those interested in scientific applications learn computer science they may not see elsewhere. ... and for all students, we wish to share the value of the Julia language as the best of both worlds. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Alan's Essay Are all programming languages the same? Superficially, many programming languages are very similar. \"Showoffs\" will compare functional programming vs imperative programming. Others will compare compiled languages vs dynamic languages. I will avoid such fancy terms in this little essay, preferring to provide this course's pedagogical viewpoint. Generally speaking beginning programmers should learn to create \"arrays\" write \"for loops\", \"conditionals\", \"comparisons\", express mathematical formulas, etc. So why Julia at a time when Python seems to be the language of teaching, and Java and C so prominent in the corporate world? As you might imagine, we believe Julia is special. Oh you will still have the nitty gritty of when to use a bracket and a comma. You might have strong opinions as to whether arrays should begin with 0 or 1 joke some say it's time to compromise and use ½. Getting past these irrelevant issues, you will begin to experience one by one what makes Julia so very special. For starters, a language that runs fast is more fun. We can have you try things that would just be so slow in other languages it would be boring. We also think you will start to notice how natural Julia is, how it feels like the mathematics, and how flexible it can be. Getting to see the true value of fancy terms like multiple dispatch, strong typing, generic programming, and composable software will take a little longer, but stick with us, and you too will see why Julia is so very special. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Computer Science and Computational Science Working Together \"\"\" md\"\"\" Applications of computer science in the real world use data , i.e. information that we can measure in some way. Data take many different forms, for example Numbers that change over time time series Stock price each second minute day Weekly number of infections Earth's global average temperature Video The view from a window of a self driving car A hurricane monitoring station Ultrasound e.g. prenatal Images Diseased versus healthy tissue in a medical scan Pictures of your favourite dog \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise Think of another two examples in each category. Can you think of other categories of data? \"\"\" md\"\"\" Computational science can be summed up by a simplified workflow \"\"\" md\"\"\" data ⟶ input ⟶ process ⟶ model ⟶ visualize ⟶ output \"\"\" md\"\"\" html\" br \" To use any data source, we need to input the data of interest, for example by downloading it, reading in the resulting file, and converting it into a form that we can use in the computer. Then we need to process it in some way to extract information of interest. We usually want to visualize the results, and we may want to output them, for example by saving to disc or putting them on a website. We often want to make a mathematical or computational model that can help us to understand and predict the behavior of the system of interest. In this course we aim to show how programming, computer science and applied math combine to help us with these goals. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Data Images as an example of data Let's start off by looking at images and how we can process them. Our goal is to process the data contained in an image in some way, which we will do by developing and coding certain algorithms . Here is the the Fall 2020 version of this lecture small variations by 3 Blue 1 Brown Grant Sanderson for your reference. \"\"\" html\"\"\" script src \"https cdn.jsdelivr.net npm lite youtube embed 0.2.0 src lite yt embed.js\" integrity \"sha256 wwYlfEzWnCf2nFlIQptfFKdUmBeH5d3G7C2352FdpWE \" crossorigin \"anonymous\" defer script link rel \"stylesheet\" href \"https cdn.jsdelivr.net npm lite youtube embed 0.2.0 src lite yt embed.css\" integrity \"sha256 99PgDZnzzjO63EyMRZfwIIA i OS2wDx6k 9Eo7JDKo \" crossorigin \"anonymous\" lite youtube videoid DGojI9xcCfg params \"modestbranding 1&rel 0\" lite youtube \"\"\" md\"\"\" If we open an image on our computer or the web and zoom in enough, we will see that it consists of many tiny squares, or pixels \"picture elements\" . Each pixel is a block of one single colour, and the pixels are arranged in a two dimensional square grid. You probably already know that these pixels are stored in a computer numerically perhaps in some form of RGB red,green,blue format. This is the computer's representation of the data. Note that an image is already an approximation of the real world it is a two dimensional, discrete representation of a three dimensional reality. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Input and Visualize loading and viewing an Image in Julia \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's use Julia to load actual images and play around with them. We can download images from the internet, your own file, or your own webcam. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Downloading an image from the internet or a local file We can use the `Images.jl` package to load an image file in three steps. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Step 1 from internet we specify the URL web address to download from html\" br \" note that Pluto places results before commands because some people believe output is more interesting than code. This takes some getting used to. \"\"\" url \"https user images.githubusercontent.com 6933510 107239146 dcc3fd00 6a28 11eb 8c7b 41aaf6618935.png\" md\"\"\" Step 2 Now we use the aptly named `download` function to download the image file to our own computer. Philip is Prof. Edelman's corgi. \"\"\" philip filename download url download to a local file. The filename is returned md\"\"\" Step 3 Using the `Images.jl` package loaded at the start of this notebook scroll up and take a look. we can load the file, which automatically converts it into usable data. We'll store the result in a variable. Remember the code is after the output. \"\"\" philip load philip filename md\" Hi there Philip \" md\"\"\" We see that the Pluto notebook has recognised that we created an object representing an image, and automatically displayed the resulting image of Philip, the cute Welsh Pembroke corgi and co professor of this course. Poor Philip will undergo quite a few transformations as we go along \"\"\" md\"\"\" 👉 Exercise change the url to use another image from the web. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Capturing an Image from your own camera \"\"\" md\"\"\" Even more fun is to use your own webcam. Try pressing the enable button below. Then press the camera to capture an image. Kind of fun to keep pressing the button as you move your hand etc. \"\"\" bind myface1 PlutoUI.WebcamInput help false, max size 150 myface1 myface1 , end 1 1 myface1 end 1 1, myface1 end 1 1, end 1 1 md\"\"\" Inspecting your data \"\"\" md\"\"\" Image size \"\"\" md\"\"\" The first thing we might want to know is the size of the image \"\"\" philip size size philip md\"\"\" Julia returns a pair of two numbers. Comparing these with the picture of the image, we see that the first number is the height, i.e. the vertical number of pixels, and the second is the width. \"\"\" philip height philip size 1 philip width philip size 2 md\"\"\" Locations in an image Indexing Now suppose that we want to examine a piece of the image in more detail. We need some way of specifying which piece of the image we want. Thinking of the image as a grid of pixels, we need a way to tell the computer which pixel or group of pixels we want to refer to. Since the image is a two dimensional grid, we can use two integers whole numbers to give the coordinates of a single pixel. Specifying coordinates like this is called indexing think of the index of a book, which tells you on which page an idea is discussed. In Julia we use square brackets, ` ` and ` ` for indexing \"\"\" a pixel philip 200, 100 md\"\"\" We see that Julia knows to draw our pixel object for us a block of the relevant color. When we index into an image like this, the first number indicates the row in the image, starting from the top, and the second the column , starting from the left. In Julia, the first row and column are numbered starting from 1, not from 0 as in some other programming languages. \"\"\" md\"\"\" We can also use variables as indices... \"\"\" md\"\"\" ...and these variables can be controlled by sliders \"\"\" bind row i Slider 1 size philip 1 , show value true bind col i Slider 1 size philip 2 , show value true row i,col i philip row i, col i md\"\"\" Locations in an image Range indexing We saw that we can use the row number and column number to index a single pixel of our image. Next, we will use a range of numbers to index multiple rows or columns at once, returning a subarray \"\"\" philip 550 650, 1 philip width md\"\"\" Here, we use `a b` to mean \" all numbers between `a` and `b` \". For example \"\"\" collect 1 10 md\"\"\" You can also use a ` ` without start and end to mean \" every index \" \"\"\" philip 550 650, md\"\"\" Let's get a single row of pixels \"\"\" philip 550, philip head philip 470 800, 140 410 md\"\"\" Scroll in on Philip's nose Use the widgets below slide left and right sides . \"\"\" bind range rows RangeSlider 1 size philip head 1 bind range cols RangeSlider 1 size philip head 2 nose philip head range rows, range cols md\"\"\" Process Modifying an image Now that we have access to image data, we can start to process that data to extract information and or modify it in some way. We might want to detect what type of objects are in the image, say to detect whether a patient has a certain disease. To achieve a high level goal like this, we will need to perform mid level operations, such as detecting edges that separate different objects based on their color. And, in turn, to carry that out we will need to do low level operations like comparing colors of neighboring pixels and somehow deciding if they are \"different\". \"\"\" md\"\"\" Representing colors We can use indexing to modify a pixel's color. To do so, we need a way to specify a new color. Color turns out to be a complicated concept, having to do with the interaction of the physical properties of light with the physiological mechanisms and mental processes by which we detect it We will ignore this complexity by using a standard method of representing colours in the computer as an RGB triple , i.e. a triple of three numbers r, g, b , giving the amount of red, of green and of blue in a colour, respectively. These are numbers between 0 none and 1 full . The final colour that we perceive is the result of \"adding\" the corresponding amount of light of each colour the details are fascinating, but beyond the scope of this course \"\"\" md\"\"\" We can create a new color in Julia as follows \"\"\" RGB 1.0, 0.0, 0.0 begin md\"\"\" A pixel with bind test r Scrubbable 0 0.1 1 default 0.1 red, bind test g Scrubbable 0 0.1 1 default 0.5 green and bind test b Scrubbable 0 0.1 1 default 1.0 blue looks like \"\"\" end RGB test r, test g, test b md\"\"\" Exercise 2.5 👉 Write a function `invert` that inverts a color, i.e. sends r, g, b to 1 r, 1 g, 1 b . \"\"\" function invert color AbstractRGB return missing end md\"Let's invert some colors \" color black RGB 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 invert color black color red RGB 0.8, 0.1, 0.1 invert color red md\"Can you invert the picture of Philip?\" philip inverted missing md\"\"\" Modifying a pixel Let's start by seeing how to modify an image, e.g. in order to hide sensitive information. We do this by assigning a new value to the color of a pixel \"\"\" let temp copy philip head temp 100, 200 RGB 1.0, 0.0, 0.0 temp end md\"\"\" Groups of pixels We probably want to examine and modify several pixels at once. For example, we can extract a horizontal strip 1 pixel tall \"\"\" philip head 50, 50 100 md\"\"\" Here, Julia is showing the strip as a collection of rectangles in a row. \"\"\" md\"\"\" And then modify it \"\"\" let temp copy philip head temp 50, 50 100 . RGB 1.0, 0.0, 0.0 temp end md\"\"\" Similarly we can modify a whole rectangular block of pixels \"\"\" let temp copy philip head temp 50 100, 50 100 . RGB 1.0, 0.0, 0.0 temp end md\"\"\" Exercise 1.2 👉 Generate a vector of 100 zeros. Change the center 20 elements to 1. \"\"\" function create bar return missing end if isdefined create bar not defined create bar else let result create bar if ismissing result still missing elseif isnothing result keep working md\"Did you forget to write `return`?\" elseif result isa Vector || length result 100 keep working md\"The result should be a `Vector` with 100 elements.\" elseif result 1,50,100 0,1,0 keep working else correct end end end md\"\"\" Reducing the size of an image \"\"\" md\"\"\" Maybe we would also like to reduce the size of this image, since it's rather large. For example, we could take every 10th row and every 10th column and make a new image from the result \"\"\" reduced image philip 1 10 end, 1 10 end md\"\"\" Note that the resulting image doesn't look very good, since we seem to have lost too much detail. Exercise Think about what we might do to reduce the size of an image without losing so much detail. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Model Creating synthetic images Think about your favorite Pixar movie e.g. Monsters Inc. Movie frames are images that are generated from complicated mathematical models. Ray tracing which may be covered in this class is a method for making images feel realistic. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Output Saving an image to a file Finally, we want to be able to save our new creation to a file. To do so, you can right click on a displayed image, or you can write it to a file. Fill in a path below \"\"\" save \"reduced phil.png\", reduced image md\"\"\" html\" br \" \"\"\" md\"\"\" Computer science Arrays An image is a concrete example of a fundamental concept in computer science, namely an array . Just as an image is a rectangular grid, where each grid cell contains a single color, an array is a rectangular grid for storing data. Data is stored and retrieved using indexing, just as in the image examples each cell in the grid can store a single \"piece of data\" of a given type. Dimension of an array An array can be one dimensional, like the strip of pixels above, two dimensional, three dimensional, and so on. The dimension tells us the number of indices that we need to specify a unique location in the grid. The array object also needs to know the length of the data in each dimension. Names for different types of array One dimensional arrays are often called vectors or, in some other languages, \"lists\" and two dimensional arrays are matrices . Higher dimensional arrays are tensors . Arrays as data structures An array is an example of a data structure , i.e. a way of arranging data such that we can access it. A key theme in computer science is that of designing different data structures that represent data in different ways. Conceptually, we can think of an array as a block of data that has a position or location in space. This can be a useful way to arrange data if, for example, we want to represent the fact that values in nearby locations in array are somehow near to one another. Images are a good example of this neighbouring pixels often represent different pieces of the same object, for example the rug or floor, or Philip himself, in the photo. We thus expect neighbouring pixels to be of a similar color. On the other hand, if they are not, this is also useful information, since that may correspond to the edge of an object. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Julia constructing arrays Creating vectors and matrices Julia has strong support for arrays of any dimension. Vectors, or one dimensional arrays, are written using square brackets and commas \"\"\" 1, 20, \"hello\" RGB 1, 0, 0 , RGB 0, 1, 0 , RGB 0, 0, 1 md\"\"\" Matrices, or two dimensional arrays, also use square brackets, but with spaces and new lines instead of commas \"\"\" RGB 1, 0, 0 RGB 0, 1, 0 RGB 0, 0, 1 RGB 0.5, 0.5, 0.5 md\"\"\" Array comprehensions It's clear that if we want to create an array with more than a few elements, it will be very tedious to do so by hand like this. Rather, we want to automate the process of creating an array by following some pattern, for example to create a whole palette of colors Let's start with all the possible colors interpolating between black, `RGB 0, 0, 0 `, and red, `RGB 1, 0, 0 `. Since only one of the values is changing, we can represent this as a vector, i.e. a one dimensional array. A neat method to do this is an array comprehension . Again we use square brackets to create an array, but now we use a variable that varies over a given range values \"\"\" RGB x, 0, 0 for x in 0 0.1 1 md\"\"\" Here, `0 0.1 1` is a range the first and last numbers are the start and end values, and the middle number is the size of the step. \"\"\" md\"\"\" In a similar way we can create two dimensional matrices, by separating the two variables for each dimension with a comma `,` \"\"\" RGB i, j, 0 for i in 0 0.1 1, j in 0 0.1 1 md\"\"\" Joining matrices We often want to join vectors and matrices together. We can do so using an extension of the array creation syntax \"\"\" philip head philip head philip head reverse philip head, dims 2 reverse philip head, dims 1 rot180 philip head md\"\"\" Pluto Interactivity using sliders \"\"\" md\"\"\" Suppose we want to see the effect of changing the number of colors in our vector or matrix. We could, of course, do so by manually fiddling with the range. It would be nice if we could do so using a user interface , for example with a slider . Fortunately, the Pluto notebook allows us to do so \"\"\" md\"\"\" We can define a slider using \"\"\" bind number reds Slider 1 100, show value true md\"\"\" The `Slider` type is defined in the `PlutoUI.jl` package. \"\"\" md\"\"\" This creates a new variable called `number reds`, whose value is the value shown by the slider. When we move the slider, the value of the variable gets updated. Since Pluto is a reactive notebook, other cells which use the value of this variable will automatically be updated too \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's use this to make a slider for our one dimensional collection of reds \"\"\" RGB red value number reds, 0, 0 for red value in 0 number reds md\"\"\" When you move the slider, you should see the number of red color patches change \"\"\" md\"\"\" What is going on here is that we are creating a vector in which `red value` takes each value in turn from the range from `0` up to the current value of `number reds`. If we change `number reds`, then we create a new vector with that new number of red patches. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise Make three sliders with variables `r`, `g` and `b`. Then make a single color patch with the RGB color given by those values. \"\"\" md\"\"\" We can do the same to create different size matrices, by creating two sliders, one for reds and one for greens. Try it out \"\"\" md\"\"\" Summary \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's summarize the main ideas from this notebook Images are arrays of colors We can inspect and modify arrays using indexing We can create arrays directly or using array comprehensions \"\"\" begin colored line x Vector Real Gray.

If the equations are linear then linear algebra tells us a general method to solve them these are now routinely applied to solve systems of millions of linear equations. If the equations are non linear then things are less obvious. The main solution methods we know work by... reducing the nonlinear equations to a sequence of linear equations They do this by approximating the function by a linear function and solving that to get a better solution, then repeating this operation as many times as necessary to get a sequence of increasingly better solutions. This is an example of an iterative algorithm . A well known and elegant method, which can be used in many different contexts, is the Newton method . It does, however, have the disadvantage that it requires derivatives of the function. This can be overcome using automatic differentiation techniques. We will illustrate the Newton method using the `ForwardDiff.jl` package to carry out automatic differentiation, but we will also try to understand what's going on \"under the hood\". \"\"\" md\"\"\" The Newton method in 1D We would like to solve equations like f x g x . We rewrite that by moving all the terms to one side of the equation so that we can write h x 0 , with h x f x g x . A point x^ such that h x^ 0 is called a root or zero of h . The Newton method finds zeros, and hence solves the original equation. \"\"\" md\"\"\" The idea of the Newton method is to follow the direction in which the function is pointing We do this by building a tangent line at the current position and following that instead, until it hits the x axis.

The idea of seam carving is to shrink an image by removing the \"least interesting\" parts of the image, but without resizing the objects within the image. We want to remove the \"dead space\" within the image. We try to find a \"seam\", i.e. a connected path of pixels from top to bottom of the image, which consists of the \"least important\" pixels, by some measure. We then remove the pixels in that seam to give an image that is one pixel narrower. In order to do this, we need to decide how to measure which pixels are \"important\". \"\"\" md\"\"\" Fall 2020 MIT Class Video from Grant Sanderson Here is Grant Sanderson 3Blue1Brown explaining seam carving using this notebook from the Fall 2020 edition of this class. \"\"\" html\"\"\" script src \"https cdn.jsdelivr.net npm lite youtube embed 0.2.0 src lite yt embed.js\" integrity \"sha256 wwYlfEzWnCf2nFlIQptfFKdUmBeH5d3G7C2352FdpWE \" crossorigin \"anonymous\" defer script link rel \"stylesheet\" href \"https cdn.jsdelivr.net npm lite youtube embed 0.2.0 src lite yt embed.css\" integrity \"sha256 99PgDZnzzjO63EyMRZfwIIA i OS2wDx6k 9Eo7JDKo \" crossorigin \"anonymous\" lite youtube videoid rpB6zQNsbQU params \"modestbranding 1&rel 0\" lite youtube \"\"\" md\"\"\" The seam carving algorithm We need to specify a notion of importance of pixels. The seam will then sum up the importance of pixels over the seam and pick the seam which minimizes this total importance. We will assign importance as \"the extent to which a pixel sits inside an edge\". So we need to calculate the \"edgeness\" of each pixel. \"\"\" md\"\"\" 1. We will use convolution with Sobel filters for edge detection. 2.

We will call the edgeness the energy . \"\"\" md\"\"\" At every step in going down, the path is allowed to go south west, south or south east. We want to find a connected path, or seam , with the minimum possible sum of \"energies\" along the path. We start by writing a `least edgy` function which takes a matrix of energies and returns a new matrix. The new matrix has entries M i, j which gives the minimum possible energy when starting from the pixel i, j and going from there down to a pixel in the bottom row. \"\"\" e x,y ↙ ↓ ↘ pick the next path which gives the least overall energy e x 1,y 1 e x,y 1 e x 1,y 1 Basic calculation e x,y min e x 1,y 1 , e x,y , e x 1,y `dirs` records which direction we take from 1 SW, 0 S, 1 SE function least edgy E least E zeros size E dirs zeros Int, size E least E end, .

The forms with the ` ` are anonymous functions. They are still considered anonymous, even though we then name them `f`. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Functions with parameters The anonymous form comes in handy when one wants a function to depend on a parameter . For example `f α x,y , x αy, x αy ` allows you to apply the `f 7 ` function to the input vector ` 1, 2 ` by running `f 7 1, 2 ` . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Linear transformations a collection \"\"\" md\"\"\" Here are a few useful linear transformations \"\"\" begin id x, y SA x, y scalex α x, y , SA α x, y scaley α x, y , SA x, α y scale α x, y , SA α x, α y swap x, y SA y, x flipy x, y SA x, y rotate θ x, y , SA cos θ x sin θ y, sin θ x cos θ y shear α x, y , SA x α y, y end T⁻¹ id T⁻¹ rotate α T⁻¹ shear α T⁻¹ lin A uses the scrubbable T⁻¹ shear α ∘ shear α T⁻¹ nonlin shear α T⁻¹ inverse nonlin shear α T⁻¹ nonlin shear α T⁻¹ xy T⁻¹ warp α T⁻¹ x,y , x α y^2,y α x^2 may be non invertible T⁻¹ x,y , x,y^2 T⁻¹ flipy ∘ x,y , β x α y β y , h y β y md\"\"\" In fact we can write down the most general linear transformation in one of two ways \"\"\" begin lin a, b, c, d x, y , a x b y, c x d y lin A v A v... linear algebra version using matrix multiplication end md\"\"\" The second version uses the matrix multiplication notation from linear algebra, which means exactly the same as the first version when A \\begin bmatrix a & b \\\\ c & d \\end bmatrix \"\"\" md\"\"\" Nonlinear transformations a collection \"\"\" translate α,β x, y , SA x α, y β affine, but not linear nonlin shear α x, y , SA x, y α x^2 warp α x, y , rotate α √ x^2 y^2 SA x, y xy r, θ SA r cos θ , r sin θ rθ x SA norm x , atan x 2 ,x 1 exponentialish x,y , log x 1.2 , log y 1.2 merc x,y , log x^2 y^2 2 , atan y,x reim log complex y,x md\"\"\" Composition \"\"\" let x rand these two are the same a sin ∘ cos x b sin cos x a b end md\"\"\" Composing functions in mathematics Wikipedia math https en.wikipedia.org wiki Function composition In math we talk about composing two functions to create a new function the function that takes x to \\sin \\cos x is the composition of the sine function and the cosine function. We humans tend to blur the distinction between the sine function and the value of \\sin x at some point x . The sine function is a mathematical object by itself. It's a thing that can be evaluated at as many x 's as you like. If you look at the two sides of ` sin ∘ cos x ≈ sin cos x ` and see that they are exactly the same, it's time to ask yourself what's a key difference? On the left a function is built ` sin ∘ cos ` which is then evaluated at `x`. On the right, that function is never built. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Composing functions in computer science wikipedia cs https en.wikipedia.org wiki Function composition computer science A key issue is a programming language is whether it's easy to name the composition in that language.

A good example would be that an optimization can wrap a highly complicated program which might include all kinds of solvers, and still run successfully. This might require the ability of the outer software to have some awareness of the inner software. It can be quite magical when two very different pieces of software \"compose\", i.e. work together. Julia's language construction encourages composability.

The easy operational but devoid of intuition definition A transformation is linear if it is defined by v \\mapsto A v matrix times vector for some fixed matrix A . The scaling and adding definition 1. If you scale and then transform or if you transform and then scale, the result is always the same T cv c \\, T v v is any vector, and c any number. 2. If you add and then transform or vice versa the result is the same T v 1 v 2 T v 1 T v 2 . v 1,v 2 are any vectors. The mathematician's definition A consolidation of the above definition. T is linear if T c 1 v 1 c 2 v 2 c 1 T v 1 c 2 T v 2 for all numbers c 1,c 2 and vectors v 1,v 2 .

Let's think about scaling again. Suppose we scale an input vector \\mathbf x by 2 to get an output vector \\mathbf x \\mathbf y 2 \\mathbf x Now suppose that you want to go backwards. If you are given \\mathbf y , how do you find \\mathbf x ? In this particular case we see that \\mathbf x \\frac 1 2 \\mathbf y . If we have a linear transformation, we can write \\mathbf y A \\, \\mathbf x with a matrix A . If we are given \\mathbf y and want to go backwards to find the \\mathbf x from that, we need to solve a system of linear equations . Usually , but not always , we can solve these equations to find a new matrix B such that \\mathbf x B \\, \\mathbf y , i.e. B undoes the effect of A . Then we have \\mathbf x B \\, A \\mathbf x , so that B A must be the identity matrix. We call B the matrix inverse of A , and write B A^ 1 . For 2 \\times 2 matrices we can write down an explicit formula for the matrix inverse, but in general we will need a computer to run an algorithm to find the inverse. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Inverting Linear Transformations \"\"\" let v rand 2 A randn 2,2 lin inv A ∘ lin A v , v end let A randn 2,2 B randn 2,2 inv A B ≈ inv B inv A end md\"\"\" ``A^ 1 \\begin pmatrix d & b \\\\ c & a \\end pmatrix ad bc \\quad `` if ``\\ A \\ \\begin pmatrix a & b \\\\ c & d \\end pmatrix . `` \"\"\" md\"\"\" Inverting nonlinear transformations \"\"\" md\"\"\" What about if we have a nonlinear transformation T can we invert it? In other words, if \\mathbf y T \\mathbf x , can we solve this to find \\mathbf x in terms of \\mathbf y ? In general this is a difficult question Sometimes we can do so analytically, but usually we cannot. Nonetheless, there are numerical methods that can sometimes solve these equations, for example the Newton method https en.wikipedia.org wiki Newton%27s method . There are several implementations of such methods in Julia, e.g. in the NonlinearSolve.jl package https github.com JuliaComputing NonlinearSolve.jl . We have used that to write a function `inverse` that tries to invert nonlinear transformations of our images. \"\"\" md\"\"\" The Big Diagram of Transforming Images \"\"\" Resource \"https raw.githubusercontent.com mitmath 18S191 Spring21 notebooks week3 comm2.png\" md\"\"\" Note that we are defining the map with the inverse of T so we can go pixel by pixel in the result. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Collisions \"\"\" begin function inverse f, y, u0 SVector 0.0, 0.0 prob NonlinearProblem false u, p f u, p . y, u0 solver solve prob, NewtonRaphson , tol 1e 4 return solver.u end inverse f y inverse u, p f SVector u... , y end md\"\"\" Check out Linear Map Wikipedia https en.wikipedia.org wiki Linear map Transformation Matrix Wikipedia https en.wikipedia.org wiki Transformation matrix \"\"\" md\"\"\" Why are we doing this backwards?
