More specifically, the site computational-thinking.mit.edu acts as a 'featured source' of pluto, search for plutojl.org in https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl/blob/main/frontend/featured_sources.js . That means: this file does not configure this website, changing things here does not change the website.",
